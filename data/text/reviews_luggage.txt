Arrived and smelled terrible! I didn't want to put any of my clothing in them so I put them in the washing machine on delicate/hand wash and this happened! Horrible quality such a disappointment and a huge waste of money.
I specifically asked for carmine red and instead got a different color. It's just frustrating to now have to do the extra work of packaging, returning, and hopefully I get the correct wallet. Clearly the label is correct on the box except for the item. Pretty sad
bag could not stand one flight from the scrap of Angeles to St. Petersburg, the fabric on the hard ribs burst with overload, the plastic parts were deformed. it's impossible to use the second time. would like to return the money
It broke right away and was unfixable
Its cheaply made it tore within the 1st mouth.
Backpack is flimsy, expected more form fit as pictured
NOTHING! They never shipped them. I needed them for my trip overseas.They were so needed.
I never received this product, I was told by the Amazon rep that it was marked as missing. It was scheduled to be delivered on the 19th in time for my vacation. I then get a text saying it was delivered yesterday the 22nd, Where did they leave it???? I'm in England, finally got a hold of my neighbor to go across the street to see, NO PACKAGE!! Now I don't blame Amazon, I blame the driver!! I received a text on Sunday the 21st 10:30 am stating it would be delivered by 9pm, I was at Burlington about to purchase a carryon, excited I didn't bother, received another text around 4:30pm saying I would not get delivery until Tuesday, this is when I call CS, and that's when they say it was marked as missing , now it has been delivered, ok where because my neighbor said she don't see it!!!
First time I used it, was in the airport leaving and the connector (gold part) that attaches the strap broke!!!! So disappointing because that's the very reason I ordered this one, was for the strap!
Would not recommend. The luggage broke on my wife's very first flight using it. She then had to scramble in a foreign country trying to find a replacement for her return home. Picture attached.
These are too small but the quality is good
We ordered two sets and one set had poor zippers that constantly sticks. Couldn't zipper at least 3 cubes in that set and we only used them twice.
Poor quality, strap broke and has only been in use for 2 months. Not worth the money. Zippers are poor quality. Would not purchase again.
If I could give this a zero, I would. So I ordered the basket. It arrived MUCH sooner than anticipated which was great. HOWEVER, they spelt my daughters name wrong on the bag. It was spelt correctly on the sticker tag, but not on the basket. I messaged them the day I received it and it has been 6 days with no response. I'm very irritated because Easter is this weekend and I now have no bag for my daughter.
I sent this bag back. It was too small.
Broken & extremely flimsy! It was smaller than stated, (2" less in length), I could tell the minute I saw it. VERY flimsy materials! I cannot believe I paid $24 for this! (My $10, dollar store bag was far better quality than this one!). One zipper is already BROKEN the first time I tried to unzip it! I can tell the other zippers won't last the upcoming 5-day trip. Now I have to travel to the next town to purchase ANOTHER bag at WalMart, which are less $$ and better quality. WHAT A RIP-OFF!
Seams failed within 5 months
The bag I received was completely different from the one I ordered. No fringe at all, just a regular bag.
Didnt get the bag I ordered and that's the only reason I ordered it was for the usb and got a bag without it
Too small......whoever can fit a week's worth of clothes in these bags are not talking about average sized clothes. They must be talking about a toddler's size or maybe petite sized clothes! Don't like them, can't return them, stuck with them. Maybe I will donate these to the 7 dwarfs! Wish I could have given ZERO stars.
Literally not the same bag. No pocket for credit cards and keys, no side pockets for umbrella/water bottles. No mesh inside pocket. It's the same shape and color that I ordered with none of the features. So annoying, I ordered this bag to hold specific items during a flight TOMORROW, and now I have to rethink my options. Thanks for the quality control, Amazon.
The bag looked nice but ripped as soon as I started putting my items inside of it.
I love the look of this backpack, but when i got it the zipper was broken and you can tell its made very cheap
Although very similar, this is not the product that I ordered. This purchase was made specifically for a trip to Europe so I will be unable to return and order a new in time before we leave.
Fits in the bag but not good with strong wind. Mine broke easily.
The material was cheap ...I took it on my trip it ripped within 30minutes of me using it and all that was in the bag was a towel 2 water bottles and a pair of flip flops ...I will not purchase again.
Smaller than what I expected!!! Thought it was bigger not a big help on what I needed it for
This is not a 17" folder it is 15" x 11" Maybe the wrong item was sent? It's going back.
I set my code and tested it multiple times before locking my luggage, had no problem opening it. Upon arriving to the hotel to go open it, the code wouldn't work. I tried the code dozens of times, different ways-starting number up then starting number down. Other people tried the code as well and couldn't open it. Eventually had to have hotel staff come and cut the locks (with scissors!) so I could get my stuff out of my luggage! I'm glad the locks locked, but incredibly unhappy the lock wasn't registering my code.
We bought this as a birthday gift for my child, and were very disappointed to find a hole out of the box. A hole on the umbrella renders it useless!
This bag is the biggest piece of crap! My husband used it for the first time traveling back to work - the bottom of the bag ripped open spilling all of the contents AND the handle broke off completely from the whole bag. Have to wait until my husband comes home to send the bag back to amazon and get a full refund. Don't spend your hard earned money in this bag! Fabric is horrible, hardware are horrible - horrible bag overall!
Very disappointed the way customer service handled the issue.
First time used was this week as a carry-on bag for a change of clothes and electronics. The shoulder strap almost completely tore off of one of the bags, so it had to be carried by the top handle which made carrying other items very difficult. Bags are very flimsy and the straps are apparently very weak and not good for a dependable carry-on with minimal weight.
Not good! I would not recommend buying!
Big enough but the drawstring broke in the very first use.
Does not even deserve one star. Seller did not ship me this item at all. They say it's because it was shipped by a third party. The 'third party' shipped me a cheap bracelet instead.
I bought this as a gift for my 12 year old daughter. She only used it for a month before it started to break apart. This item was cheaply made and very disappointing. The zipper no longer works and one side has completely come apart at the seems. Don't waste your money.
I should have trusted the bad reviews. This luggage came on the luggage carousel cracked after the very first flight. Since we ordered early, we were past the deadline for returns. I can exchange it for another, but am not sure I really want to bother with it to just get another flimsy piece of luggage.
only after using this for three weeks. the damn straps came off. BOTH. it does not fit my MacBook and it is not as good as it looks in the picture. Not Worth spending a penny on it. thanks.
I bought this back pack and the very first day she took it to school she came home and showed me the zipper had broke. I had ordered two backpacks back on February 27, 2019 and she had been using one backpack first and decided to not use the other until Monday April 1, 2019. Unfortunately for me the window for returning closed on March 31, 2019. Lesson here folks, if you order something make sure you use it right away to see if it is going to fall apart or not. Chris April 4, 2019
I have other SwissGear travel items that are made with better quality material. Perhaps that's why this price was set so low...
Great fabric, love look but handle does not stay fully extended well. Should it be returned? Not sure. Depends if you can get used to handle dropping down on it's own.
Zipper broke and supplier never replaced as promised. Still have not received refund for item as they promised.
Zipper Broke after one use.
Liked the look of the bag and hardshell at the bottom of the bag but upper handle shaft broke after 2 weeks of regular use trying push it down.
Dimensions are wrong says 16w is only 15. My laptop wont fit
Can't believe how it ripped so easily by the shoulder straps. Truly disappointed since the bags are not cheap.
returned - was really cute but would have lasted 2 hr at most
The customer service is slow and useless. I wish I could rate this product zero star. It took me 3 months, several calls, and countless hours on the phone to issue a refund (still unresolved) for a broken product. Amazon should stop selling all Asurion products due to the poor customer service experience.
My set came with a large suitcase and the tote bag, but no middle sized suitcase was included. If someone with the company could please message me to get this resolved, I would greatly appreciate it. I purchased one of these in the past and it was great but I feel very much ripped off and this experience leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.
Horrible customer service luggage took longer to receive than stated then my refund was short money they said was a restocking fee
In less than six months the female magnetic closure pulled thru the fabric because it is not reinforced. I love this bag, it does everything I want But this one little thing makes the bag Useless. i believe it would only cost a few penny's to have reinforced that area. Tried to use it this way but an 800 dollar phone fell out when i bent over so can't take that chance anymore. Would not buy this bag again until they correct this fault
The colour I ordered it thinking it was bright yellow but it's more of a mustard colour
Does not come close to fitting under seat on a Delta plane. And flew select comfort.
False advertisement. It states it's black and white, but they forget to add brown. Yes brown! Not what I was expecting. And to top it off now I have to lose out of the shipping for this item.
So the bag I received was not what I purchased. Look at the photos I posted. I hope it was a mix up.
I sure hope this hold up for my son's carry-on bag. I don't have high hopes for it to hold up longer than this one trip. As long as it makes it this one trip for him I will be okay with that. However, I don't recommend it.
At first sight loved this bag. I bought for the wheels and to fit under seat on flights. However on the first flight the color came off. After roundtrip flights the bag looks like it been throught hell. Very disappointing because the bag has a great design I guess poor quality.
The hole for the handle was on the wrong side. Very difficult to use.
I thought this would be a great carry on bag for my laptop (which is in a sleeve). Didn't even reach my destination and the zipper broke. I'll have to buy a new bag for the return trip.
My daughter loves it but the zipper broke after 1 week. So now it's sitting in the closet not being used. That item was on her Christmas wish list.
This bag is so small , you can only put a few things in it. I wouldn't recommend this bag!!!
I got 2 of these bags in different colors. the zippers on both of them are troublesome. The hanger clip is plastic, overall cheap feeling.
I wanted to love this umbrella because it sounded durable and I love the color red. However, it is impossible to close this umbrella once it has been open. I've stood in the pouring rain trying to quickly close this thing so I could get in my car!!! Horrible!! I don't see myself using this at all!!
I ordered this backpack about two months ago and the both straps have already broken. This quality is not very good at all.
Just started using product a month ago. Falling apart. I have pictures of where the seams are separated.
I will never buy anything from here again I bought 1 and decided to buy 2 more the other did not come I contacted the seller no response no refund or nothing. I don't know but it seem like it's a lot of problems with orders coming from China that takes to long or something happen to your order I it's been months now did not hear nothing from them at all
The difficulty I had with using these is that you it goes around the entire headrest -- which means that if the seats have video screens on the backs of them, you're going to be obstructing the person's view behind you! So that's not an option. On seats without video screens I did use it, but it was really awkward and my head was held in this straight upright position which actually wasn't that conducive to sleeping. If you're on Spirit or Frontier where the seats don't recline -- really not comfortable unfortunately.
bag seems adequate for a child but not an adult. Too small.
Stopped working after 1 week. No way to chage batteries, if that is the issue.
So disappointed! I ordered 6 of these and one came without the metal loop so that was useless. They were difficult to attach to the luggage but seemed secure once I got them on. However, only two of them survived the flight, 3 of them were missing when our luggage arrived. I will not be buying these again.
I sent this back. The quality was not what I expected.
I had read some of the other reviews prior to purchasing but didn't think much of the ones that stated it smelt like gasoline. However those were the ones I should have paid attention to. It was so strong I had to return it. My wife even asked why there was the smell of gas in the house.
This is way too small. Not a good item!
I'm not a fan of the purchase, once received I could immediately tell it was a fraud from the lightness of the material and the zipper on the smaller pocket. I didn't want to believe it at first, so I searched for the tag, which looked okay; but, then I studied the classic Herschel patch, and that's when my suspicions were confirmed. I compared it against my wallet's patch and then I saw the difference. "The" on the bag's patch was TNE not THE. I'm very unhappy with this product. Will I use it? Of course, I paid for it. But I'm not expecting the weak material to last long.
Doesn't look like what it was in the picture and it doesn't look that good when it comes in.
delay for nearly a month
Zipper broke after using twice.
I don't want to be that guy, but I thought this was going to be WAYYYYYYY bigger than it is. I returned it.
Till this day I have not received my backpack nor does anyone from the company respond to my emails.
While some people pointed out some premature wear in their reviews, overall the reviews were good so I purchased this suitcase only 3 months ago. It made 3 domestic trips and I was packing it to take it internationally and the zipper just split. It was not overpacked, just a faulty zipper on this product.
just twice the handle is broken cannot pull up.
Carry on was missing. Looked like it was used and had been repackaged.
Bought in August and used a few times. One of the spokes has already broke by mid October.
Broke after 3 hours of use. Really cute bag but made very cheaply.
Broke already haven't had this but a couple of months
For the quality of the product I am not sure if is a original brand.
These are not very well made. The zipper on the first time trying came apart. If I wasn't leaving in a free days I would return them and order different ones.
Considering how this product got great reviews, it's likely I received a defective bag. Shoulder strap snapped on Day 1. Working on getting a refund..
I am not quite happy with this piece. It doesn't hold the clothes on both sides so u open it and everything is upside down. I like the color but it's not working for me. And I should have gotten the smaller size for carryon.
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
Never received product very disappointed
Returned wasn't what I wanted
This was not the design on the picture shown. This was supposed to be a gift for a runner and this says soccer on the front back and drawstrings.
I didn't like the fact that the straps don't last long all I had in my bag was a tablet a notebook pens pencils and highlighters. If they improve the straps the bag would be wonderful it's the perfect size
I give it a star because of the color. Other than that I am highly unsatisfied with this item. I lost my stuff because of this poor quality luggage.
Not the color I ordered. Very disappointed.
The zipper was broken. Gave this as a gift - broken
Horrible quality. Pocket came unstitched on first trip the bag was taken on.
We looked all over Amazon for a new set of luggage and finally settled on this set after comparing price and reviews. Our main concern was the durability of the set. Well our fears were realized on our 1st trip. The luggage was nice and light, rolled well, had great space inside but when we picked up our luggage at the baggage claim, the largest one was missing a wheel. It had completely ripped off of the case, exposing the fabric inside the shell. The middle one lost one of the bumpers on it's spine, exposing two metal studs. Luckily United had 2 new suitcases that they swapped out right then and there for us. It just seemed like the better way to go instead of filing a claim and purchasing this set a 2nd time. We really wanted to like the set too...pretty bummed at the quality.
The bag size is convenient but the smell of plastic never ceased. Also the material was very cheap looking. Could not return as they charge $5 to return.
Never received the item.
Very disappointed with the bag. The pocket had unraveling thread hanging. The inside zipper area also had thread hanging, the bag was dirty on the outside. Very poorly made. Really did not even deserve one star.
They blur out the metal circle on the front because it is in a foreign language.
The wallet would be great if I'd received it. UPS posted a picture of the package on a front porch, just not MY front porch. No one from Amazon has contacted me even after I gave feedback through the email they sent me. Guess I'm out of a travel wallet and fan. Needless to say...I'm not happy.
Although this backpack is lightweight and has many great pockets for all items, the strap constantly unsnaps. It has happened every single time I have put the bag on. It is super annoying. The plastic snap pops and the strap drops. The plastic snap is not broken it just disengages constantly. Not what you want on a 2-week trip through Europe.
Originally wrote a review when using the carryon size without issue. Photo attached is the medium size page after second use from a two hour flight at a low volume airport. Please note: the warranty specifically states it does not cover damage from "damage or loss by airline" rendering this bag as worthless. A product at a minimum should perform for the use that it was purchased. This product was purchased for an upcoming trip to europe. Wouldn't that be special. Never again. And this was the newer model over the abs plastic models. Not sure how they could be worse.
bought this because i was spending 3 months in london. wind proof? in what world? it flips inside out every time i take it outside. it is also extremely difficult to close. wish i could give 0 stars
Last a whole two trips before it broke. On the first trip, hard shell dented. Second trip, zipper popped. Luggage has never been checked and is well cared for. Yes, it's beautiful. But you don't need to spend $100 on beautiful that lasts a month. Disappointed that I am out of my return window for this item.
The hardware is falling off. I need to exchange for another color.
Bought backpack for my daughter for kindergarten and didn't even last a month the zipper broke there was loose strings from stitching then week later second zipper breaks and now backpack won't close at all very cheaply made and seller doesn't do anything about it
Bad and not like pictures
Terrible , strap ripped off the first week. Other side is holding on by a thread .
Not for a junior high school kid way to much stuff bottom broke, handle felt like it was unlevel
Really poor, bad quality!!
it looks nice but the strap cannot be adjusted properly and looks it is about to break. If your laptop is expensive, you should consider this as it might fall
The shipment was late I bought it for a trip I was taking where I needed to pack lightly. It was supposed to be here on Monday it is now Thursday and I still haven't received a waste of my money for this trip
VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT. I took it on vacation and it FELL apart the very first day that I used it. Now, it is past the 30 days and I have no RECOURSE...Really!! I have used Amazon for over 10 years and I have never been so unhappy with the quality of a product. I want my $$$$ back!!!
This very cute tote smelled toxic. The odor was very very strong.
5 stars for design and quality. 1 star for product being delivered with scratches on it. It is hard to understand why the tag would have scratches when it is way over packaged. Granted, it is going to get beat up at the airport by the baggage handlers however if you pay for new, you should receive new.
It tore at the seam after having it for a week
If you are looking for a quality backpack that you can use for a while, this bag is not it. I order the bag and had to return the first one because the straps were unraveling. I asked for a replacement thinking it was just a fluke and I've been carrying the new on for about 6 weeks and the straps are unraveling as well. This bag is not well put together. Don't waste your money.
Don't Buy! Junk! Didn't last one round trip flight. Don't be fooled by the price. One round trip flight and the handles bent so they wouldn't extend. The zippers broke. Don't BUY! Junk!
I returned this product and I never received my refund
Bought this set based on reviews. Traveled to London then to Ukraine in July 2017. Outer shell had many scratches and a corner had dent when arrived in Ukraine. London was a layover so I didn't see luggage until Ukraine. I only took the smallest and largest on this trip. Smallest I used as carry-on. On return trip, when I arrived back home, my checked luggage had one of its wheel completely broken off. Looks like it was true when some said seller was giving longer warranties for good reviews. So l would recommend looking elsewhere. Why did I wait so long to review? Wasn't on my list of priorities. I'm eating the cost and not looking for any redemption from seller. So good luck. Will try to add photos later.
Was a great designe but the fabric was thin and the finishing were not good, too bad because was super nice designe.
It did not compress items as much as it showed on the website.
The moment I take it out of the package I see that the bag was damaged
Our package came very wet on the inside. My daughter was disappointed in her toy that she wanted. It got tossed in the trash.
The first time I tried to open it, the zipper was stripped and would not work. Unfortunately I had removed the tags and this is now completely useless to me. Will not zip closed.
I did not order a 4pk rubber cages for a iPhone. I have a galaxy s9. I ordered a 4pk slim card hold. Bummer this is a waste of shiping & time. I was looking for to sticking them on the back of my phone case. No I have to wait even longer. What's the point in having Amazon prime when u still have to wait long than expected for ur stuff.
Don't order from this seller. I was sent a pair of knock off Victoria secret underwear instead of a suitcase. I contacted the seller multiple times...never received the suitcase that I ordered!!
Umbrella is cheaply made and too flimsy. 2 out of 4 umbrellas I purchased doesn't hold the lock, it would close by itself. Edit: Reached out to the seller, no reply. Garbage product and shady seller.
Image is deceiving. Bigger than what the picture makes it look, make sure to look at specifications when buying.
Fast shipping but product is horrible and poorly made
I was to receive 2 bags what it advertised for on Amazon's choice, I only got one in the package. Can you please send the other one I paid for?
I received only 2pc and it's says 4pc in the details nice backpack but very disappointed.
trash. fell apart from every possible seam and angle, a few weeks into the trip. our kid is not even that strong.
Slime was a watery mess and not enough
It looks like new but the package is so dirty and damaged.
This umbrella is horrible. The plastic is so cheap. It ripped as soon as my 2.5yo opened it. The piece that wraps around the folded umbrella tore off and left a large hole. The ends came off the skeleton when I opened it. This was an Easter gift, and now it's going back. Buyer beware, it's not nylon, its plastic. It feels like a garbage bag.
Poor quality didn't last two months, not recommended
Zipper arrived broken already, handle strap at the metal end was also broken upon arrival! Not sure where they got all the great reviews! Was far from what I received! Returned it
At least it came right before Spring Break, so I have a week to air it out. If the smell doesn't dissipate, into the trash it goes. I wouldn't want ANYONE touching this toxic junk.
This wallet was not as expected. Poor craftsmanship. One of the seams is coming apart right out of the box. Credit cards do not fit easily into the wallet. Upon requesting to return the wallet, I am being charged for shipping.
The delivery was stolen. I received a refund from Amazon. Never heard from the seller.
from day 1, this umbrella was hard to open. i didn't discover this until it actually rained in los angeles (which it doesnt do often) and when i realized this, it was too late to return or exchange it. the button doesnt work at all, i have to wrestle it and pull/shake do about 4 different movements before this umbrella opens. DONT BUY THIS.
It's pretty. But the strings on the bag isn't well made and are coming apart and they aren't even on the bag. I needed this bag for my baby shower as part as the big sister survival kit. I'm using it, but not happy that it's not in excellent condition
Can't give zero stars. Does not work at all. Tried it at home and it was fine; traveled to GA and it didn't work AT ALL. Too late to return it.
Strap is too thin. Eventually starts hurting my shoulder. Do not over fill the bag or the strap will brake. Don't recommend this product.
The color was great but it was not big enough
It broke as soon as my daughter put in 1 of her books. It wasn't even used! Also, we received it in an opened box, and with NO packing slip, NO note, nothing. Not sturdy at all. "heavy duty" is a joke. How do I get a refund? I went and purchased another clear backpack since the school would have sent her how without a clear backpack.
I just received my bag today and I'm going to return it. What a joke, this bag neither smells or looks anything like real leather. I should of known better when I saw the price tag, but I got drawn in by the picture which is also not accurate in terms of the color. Oh well lesson learned I guess. Boxing and returning today.
The zipper didn't work from the moment we got it.
Cheap zipper. Broke in less than a week.
Over time - we use daily as a figure skate bag... the wheels will rust (cosmetic), and the other pattern we have, the handle broke and wheel casters came off.... so have gone through 2 of these, one is still mostly functional but likely not much longer... would have expected better --- this has potential and would likely be good if you use only occasionally... but will not last for daily use (parking lot to ice rink, and back). And if you want to use the warranty - you must pay $40 handling charge, shipping costs, and hassle of evaluation forms and more! Rockland FAIL!
I bought this for the size since I was traveling abroad for a few weeks. I figured since this was my first trip with this bag it would at least hold up for awhile. Unfortunately, after the first day of travel and it being through two lay overs it was completely unusable. Wish I'd of taken the review photos more seriously.
I could have left zero stars. This purse is NOT leather, but is advertised as so. I am very disappointed. I have not been able to return it yet, but still need to.
I never received my backpacks. But the money was taken out of my acct
Did lose the package somewhere. Wanted to gift them they didn't respond and was not available. It was to be gifted on B'Day which I couldn't! Sad sad sad.
Not well made Zipper broke after first use.
I DID NOT RECIEVE MY WARRANTY!!!
Zipper not working on second go, and then properly dented on 3rd use. Quite disappointed.
Haven't had the bag 24 hours and it's ripped. Love the colors and organization but craftsmanship is obviously questionable.
I bought this backpack this summer for my son to take to Kindergarten. He loves it! Unfortunately, the zipper on both sides has come apart, and two weeks into Kindergarten I have to buy another backpack!!!! My son wants another one just like this one, so that it will match his lunchbox, but I'm skeptical to purchase something that has already been destroyed so quickly.
After one trip 1 wheel was distroyed and a hole worn in the bottom. I traveled to Maryland from Alabama on a train, the bag was with me at all times and not abused. What happened to good quality Olympia bags? I have another Olympia bag that is 18 years old. I took it all over the world and it is still in decent shape.
I have had this bag for while now, couple of months, and the leather on the strap is starting to peel. It doesn't even get used everyday. I ended up buying a different brand and feel like throwing this out. This is disappointing because otherwise the bag has a lot going for it.
Way to small..... It doesn't fit an iPad air... It holds just a few items but the spacing is weird...
Do NOT buy these locks. Literally anyone with a paper clip can open your lock in a second. So I was fiddling around setting my new code for these locks I purchased for an upcoming trip — and noticed the TSA keyhole only had one tumbler that I could see. So, Just for fun I used the paper clip I had on hand and bent it into the shape you see in the photos. Inserted into the keyhole, and the lock opened right away. Completely useless locks. Even a child with a paperclip can open these.
I bought this backpack for my daughter to surprise her for her 10th birthday. I received a poorly made fake version worth less than half of wha to paid. (I googled the hot topic version) Very disappointed they'd send a fake especially after seeing all these good reviews.
Item ripped in several spots. Poor thread quality. Save your money. Don't buy. There is suppose to be a lifetime warranty but I am unable to contact the seller, as there is no information listed.
The tote I received was NOT what I ordered. I received a purple and white Chevron pattern tote that was labeled "Ever Moda Arrow Tote." I called for to get a replacement and they sent me the exact same thing! I was going to return them both for a refund but missed the return date deadline. Now I have two purple and white Chevron pattern totes that are labeled "Ever Moda Arrow Tote."
I purchased this item for my 11 year old daughter to use this school year. The zipper came off the track while she was zipping it up for the first time. There was nothing caught in the zipper, nor was the bag overfilled to cause this issue to occur. The return is already in process.
Hi I really like your product but the thing is when I am going to use it and leave the house for my week end vacation the handle got broke..I didn't even left the house yet.. here is the picture of my bad.
No it really looks cheap in person! Don't know why we didn't return it, probably won't use it, just to busy to deal with returning at that time.
Very cheap quality product almost all the zippers are damaged .
I wish 0 is on the option. I order a lot staff never happened like this . Wrong and fake marketing, am still dealing to get my full refund , they make a lot A lot excuse not to refund my money. Even they want me to pay a shipment (WAS FREE )in the 1st time. I spent $70 but they wanna give me $40 unbelievable pls stay away from this seller. Its caming from China fake cheap products 😡😡😡
This item's string has already broken on each side of the sleeping mask. I have had to "save the day" by sewing it back together. For 6 or more dollars, it's not worth it. I should not have to sew it!!! Bummer cause it's cute and fits my 6 year old.
I got this wallet around two years ago and initially really loved it - it is very convenient and holds everything you would need for travel. However, when I used it again on my last trip I noticed that the entire lining became very sticky and left a sticky film on everything I had in the pockets (including credit cards, money, passport, etc.). I did not spill anything in the wallet or leave it in a particularly hot area that would have caused it to melt. I also only used the wallet when travelling abroad, so in two years it only had a few uses. Although i really liked it when I first got it, it's basically useless now because everything I put in it comes out gross. Very disappointed!
The comb is nice, but the scissors are crap. They do not function smoothly, there is too much friction while operating them. Hard to explain, but as if they are catching on something when trying to open/close them, if that makes sense. Feels like faulty manufacturing.
Wanted to like it but the smell of this material was very strong - almost mildewy like - and it also did not fit comfortably across my body. which is why I returned it. Unfortunate, but I would not recommend this.
The bag looks good but it's kinda flimsy and unable to stand on it's own. The top opening sleeve and lack of a luggage strap makes it hard to travel with. And it scratches really easily. Barely had it for a week and it looks like I have been using it for years. I also found it to be heavier than other similar bags I have held (colleagues have them). Overall, not quite the long term bag I was hoping it would be.
The item worked great for 3 uses but then one of the support arches come out of its holder so we had to glue it back in place. Then the next time, a spring broke in the device that keeps the umbrella open so now it doesn't work after only a few uses. It also can't be returned because it's been too long.
Very small and not expandable - Flimsy material. I travel weekly and was looking for a small bag for a couple day trip. This bag is very cheaply made (although not so cheap in price). I would spend a bit more and get name brand luggage.
GREat concept, nice design but in functionality it's not worth it. Zipper broke on the first trip.
It's smaller than I thought. Now I gotta look for another one now
The zipper at the top stripped when we received the bag. I could not fix this so the bag was not usable.
The design concept is good. However, the actual product delivered was horrible quality! The biggest con for me is that NONE of the pockets fit a standard sized paper. My resumes ended up getting wrinkled. The folder slots are thin, cheap, plastic.
The plastic hinge is coming apart now, which is going to happen within a matter of time when bending plastic over and over through the years. That said, it was okay while it lasted but be careful because it has a tendency to pop pills across the room when shutting the individuals plastic lids. For that alone, I would not buy it again.
I love the bag, but I have not even had it 2 months. All I carry in it is my planner and my iPad and the strap is already ripping and fraying off. I wish I knew how to contact them to see if they will replace it.
Use for on trip on the way out shell scratched badly then on second leg of trip bottom corner was smashed in making on oh the wheels inoperable. My last suitcase lasted twelve years with out half this much damage
Zipper broke one month in to school.
Chain broke in half after second time using it. The mesh inside tore.
4 nice plastic luggage tags, but missing 3 of the 4 steel loops to attach them to my luggage. Hole in the bag and the fell out before shipping.
The strap cannot not be placed vertically in the middle of the bag as the design does not allow the ends to be separated. (See attached picture) In addition you must have very good strength in your hands to open the clasp. It is attractive.
The suitcase itself can hold enough shoes and clothes for about a week. When fully expanded it is a bit of a squish to fit into the overheads of smaller planes. At first it wheeled like a dream. Being able to roll on all 4 or tilted on 2 wheels was really convenient. However, the 3rd time I used it the wheel broke off. I ended up having to carry it all around the airport. Really disappointed with the quality since I initially thought this was going to be a great purchase. The hard case seems like good quality and doesn't scratch or dent easily. But I wouldn't repurchase since it didn't last long.
I had a Chelsea for a year that I loved, but I accidently left it in my pants and washed in the wash machine. After that the pull tab no longer retracted after being pulled. It was a no brainer to replace it and buy another, so I ordered one and had it here the next day. Unfortunately it looks like something has changed in the manufacturing. The pull tab that is supposed to be elastic and fully retract after you pull it, no longer retract. The elastic tab now is replaced by a red canvas looking tab. When you pull it to lift the cards out of the wallet, it just hangs there until you push the cards back in with your hand. I am going to have to return this and look to another style which sucks because the original was a great wallet, but this tab change is a deal breaker.
Zipper stitching on front pocket zipper beginning to loosen after first short trip. Very disappointed as it was good size and features otherwise.
So the backpack is a ugly grey color it looks olive green
I bought this for an overseas trip and used it daily for shore excursions and day trips. This size is good for carrying one day's supplies of snacks, camera batteries, travel umbrella, etc. I bought a small travel wallet with a built in hoop that I attached to the "key holder" inside the backpack for extra security. The multitude of interior pockets are unnecessary and just added weight if you use a wallet with the backpack. The external water bottle pocket is useless if your are right handed. I used the backpack over my left shoulder so I could slide it around to my right side without taking it off and access the contents with my right hand. This leaves a water bottle "dangling" in the water bottle holder. Even when wearing the pack on my back, the water bottle is "dangling" and falls out. The first time I used it with my Thermos water bottle, it dropped out and dented the bottle and broke the lid, so it was not available for the rest of the trip. Even plastic disposable water bottles fell out. The bag either needs water bottle holders on both sides so that at least one is usable, or better yet, an elastic anchor strap to securely hold water bottle in place. The external water bottle pouch was the one thing that sold me on this daypack, yet it proved to be almost useless when I used it for real world activities.. A major design flaw so far as I'm concerned. Good security features, but useless water bottle holder.
Zipper broke after 3 uses
Money clip is worthless, cards do not slide out easily,
Very thin plastic it was ripped when it arrived at the handle but it's pretty but I wasted my money
Much smaller than expected and made of thin material. I returned it.
Purse works and is easy to keep clean. However, just outside the return window I noticed the stitching came apart on part of the strap.
Very expensive. For the price I was expecting better materials used for the liner and cushioning. The cushion on the shoulder straps and inside the back pack feel like very cheap dollar store Foam. It is very thin and my bag was deformed when it arrived. Only reason I don't give this one star is it fits my gloves perfectly along with my go and shin guard. I expected far more from the hayabusa brand name.
It's a pretty looking Fanny pack but it's not waterproof I bought this for my daughter she used it for the first time yesterday and all her money got wet and her phone was destroyed. Do not go in water with this bag.
I like the material it's made of and all the slots for credit cards. But I don't like the size, it's way smaller than what it looks like in the picture. Not big enough to hold my cell phone.
Was a nice bookbag. Then it broke after just 2 months!
I am pretty disappointed in the first of the two-pack. It fell apart after only one month of use; two of the pages separated. The size of the pages also seem to be just a tad small in width. Putting one ID/credit card in the sleeve is OK. However, putting two inside one sleeve, which is a reasonable expectation, is a very tight fit. I will upgrade my review if the second one lasts significantly longer.
This luggage came with a broken handle. It was too close to my trip to return it. Everything else about the luggage is great except that the handle doesn't retract properly.
It's ok but there's no place to put money! You could put it in slots but its pretty inconvenient
Have not used it yet
This briefcase is heavy. The whole thing squeaks and strains under its own weight when being carried by the handle, you know, like the way you'd expect to carry a briefcase that only has a handle. Technically it's expandable, but that's by way of unsnapping a flexible gusset from the inside. The folds of gusset material are kind of in the way of keeping items that are a full 11x17 inside. And since the gusset is at the bottom of the case you have to some how pile in all your crap then hoist up the rim to latch to the lid. The nominal width inside is a hair over 17 inches, but the hinges limit the width to 16 1/4 inches. So you can only store full sheets at the bottom (where the gusset and buttons are sticking out).
I used this exactly twice and the top handle broke off, while I'm carrying it down the aisle of the airplane. So disappointed.
Beautiful backpack with the perfect amount of pockets. Was extremely disappointed when the strap started to tear after just two weeks.
This bag is huge, yet holds very little. By the time you put in a slim profile laptop, you've used up about 2/3 of the available space. Nice quality bag, but the gold is very brassy, which to me, is ugly & kinda tacky. Handle was nice & high. Perfect for some one 5' 9" & a but taller. For a much shorter person, I would imagine the bottom of the bag could possibly dragged on the ground.
I wanted to love this but the quality of the zipper was just too bad! The zipper sticks really bad and it's difficult to open/close it so I returned it. Also, if you are on the thin side you will need to tighten it all the way and you will have excess strap hanging down.
I am more upset with myself than anything, I usually do a thorough search, I didn't and what I got was a very cheaply made piece of nylon with a zipper. This is about $12 over priced and that upsets me the most. Oh well lesson learned.
Quality is a issue! Very cute. I loved the idea of a shoe compartment. However the zipper broke on the first use. Wouldn't recommended.
I bought this as a second option to my Trayvax and thought it might be better...I was wrong. It is a pretty bad design. The cards get pulled sideways and bent in the metal recessed credit card slot (compared to Trayvax the cards sit perfectly flush and the leather wraps around it) The clasp stands out way too much, the knurled hand screws are also a big obstruction in your pocket, and it damages anything else you have in your pocket with it. The money clip is not raised away from the card slot area, so sliding money in under it is very tight and hard to do, especially if you have a few bills or need to quickly grab 1 bill from the clip. Very bad design. (Compared to the Trayvax that has a money clip raised to accommodate easy money access) The size is too big for my liking. (Trayvax is significantly smaller and does the same job) Lastly, the rope cutter/package opener below the closing clip severely damages the leather strap because as soon as you tightly close it up, the strap slips into the recess and rubs against the cutter/package opener blade.
What I like about this product is that slick & stylish design and it is waterproof. BUT not even a month of using it, i noticed that it's starting to wear off.
Side pockets too small for anything significant.
The luggage is light and beautiful in color. After one year of purchase, traveling with it on 3 different trips, one of the wheel of the bigger luggage was completely knocked off. I guess price does come with value. I am guessing the more expensive won't have this problem.
Wasn't what I actually wanted
Zipper broke after less than a month. Otherwise OK.
This is WAY too small for this price. It will not suffice for holding the books and items needed for the upcoming school year
Zipper to main compartment keep pulling apart. Defeated the purpose of being a waterproof bag, if the bag itself keeps popping open. Woulda been a great bag otherwise.
I'm bummed because after maybe a month the zipper is fraying and keeps getting caught.
The purse smells a lot. I wanted to wear it for my cabin trip but the smell is overwhelming. I tried to spray it with perfumes but it's still the same. It is not easy to open the purse either.
It's a gorgeous bag but poorly made. As soon as I took it out the box one of the zippers fell off. I didn't even get a chance to wear it I'm very disappointed!
Looks like it may rip[p at the seam in no time. Cheap plastic
Within a week the strap broke. It's a cute design, but disappointed in the quality. The strap was part of the appeal.
I used this 4 times and it broke. Not impressed
Received this today and opened the luggage to find the strap not properly sewn in. Unfortunately I cannot return it as this is needed for a trip tomorrow and I dont have any other luggage available.
I made the mistake of bringing these as my luggage on a three week trip to Europe. The biggest problem was that the zipper rain cover is thin and and at just the right length to get caught in the zipper. Goes in easily, but very hard to get back out. And even after I was aware of the problem I had to be extremely careful to keep it from happening again - AND IT STILL HAPPENED THREE MORE TIMES! The other problems were not as bad, but I don't need any luggage problems: When you unzip the cover for the pull handle there is nothing covering your clothes in the top of the backpack. Also neither bag opens up with cover flat so you are stuffing everything into the bottom. I returned these and bought a bag from an experienced luggage manufacturer who didn't make such rookie mistakes.
Poor quality, broke in about three weeks, but its cheap so what did I expect?
Bought for my daughter as school back. She liked style and waterproof but after3 weeks, the straps broke and are unrepairable. There wasn't way to notify seller on order page and see if there was a warranty period.
Way too small. Going to have to return it..=(
Used six of these on a recent family trip. Four flights later, two of them were bent. They are made of some sort of metal, maybe aluminum, and if they get tossed around or mangled in the luggage processing facility they will bend. The idea is good - I like only being able to see your name on the info card and your address and phone number covered but having them bent up after only one use? They need to change the material to a silicone or leather type of material that can handle being tossed around by man and machine.
In the time of high tech materials and travel weight restrictions, you'd think Tumi would come up with a lightweight travel hanger. Instead, we get this steel monstrosity that weights twice your home hangers. C'mon, Tumi! You are the tech travel beacon, get your carbon fiber team together and be a leader! Until then, I'm back to a wood hanger in my suitcase to save weight. Now, nothing wrong with the product quality, stellar as always with Tumi, it just isn't a "travel" product.
The scale worked well for a few measurements. unfortunately the plastic clasp broke while weighing a 15 kg backpack. I have contacted the customer support twice as this should be under warranty but have received no reply.
Wasn't to happy after a week or so screws began to fall out. By the time i noticed it was only being held by 3 screws.
The style of this bag is consistent with the medium and large suitcases but the color is slightly off and therefore doesn't match the rest of the set. I had to return the bag.
Paper thin, will most likely fall apart within a week. Not worth 12 dollars.
I was excited when it got here. The bag looks really nice but tore from the bottom just a month later.
This thing is not durable at all. After two completely normal trips, this bag had several holes worn into it near the corners and the frame was completely bent out of shape. I can see why it is on sale for 66% off.
The cardholder I received having a different pattern and look than it was shown on Amazon. I am very disappointed. I think I got a counterfeit product.
It's a great size for a weekend bag and love the slot to go over a carry on roller bag. However, the zipper is unreliable. After a few uses the zipper broke and has been a headache since to keep closed. ZIPPER IS A JOKE! HORRIBLE. NEED REPLACEMENT.
The backpack it's cute, but the finish work on this one with the red pen make me upset because I can't clean it up. Also some parts are already peeling.
Both the zippers broke within the first month of use.
I am missing one cup wich is the small one
It's nice material but you can't even fit card into it you have to shove at a certain angle in order for your cards to go in.
I like that it holds a lot of clothing and it can reduce down to fit in a small space for boat travel. But it is extremely difficult to maneuver in an airport because it doesn't have a handle. This is very difficult! And the reason I couldn't rate it higher.
The material of the buckle and the straps are cheap. It seems that the buckle will not survive being tossed around in the airport and will snap. Also, the straps seem like they will get worn out pretty fast. On the other hand, I love the bright color of the straps!
It is very poor quality for the price
Zipper split for week of use. Loved everything else, just wished it lasted longer.
This review is from my perspective of visiting certain European countries which are notorious for pickpockets. I personally feel this pouch is pretty useless in that regard. Not only it's bulky --- nowhere near "invisible" under the clothing as advertised --- the major flaws: 1) The zipper compartments are SIDEWAY, with the locked position at the top of the zipper. This makes no sense to me, because if the zipper lock shifted down (or any pickpocket zip it down), everything in the side compartment would fell off 2) There is no horizontal zipping compartment. An horizontal zipper compartment would makes things less likely falling out. 3) The biggest compartments (back of the pouch) uses velcro. This is 21st Century, hello??? It does not make any retrieval of items any easier. I also happened to have Zero Grid (I am not affiliated) which addresses most of the issues above. The plus with Zero Grid: a) Two horizontal zipping compartments, one of them large enough to hold an iPhone XR (but not anything bigger, that's a minus vs this Venture pouch) b) Zero Grid has the belt bands but this Venture does not .... If you intent to use it around your pant, Zero Grid is the way to go. c) Zero Grid comes with stickers for lost item retrieval (free sign up) ... I stick them onto the back of my family's four passports for peace of mind. It also comes with like $250 lost/stolen guarantee. d) Zero Grid uses double strip --- harder to break (but not sure if it's cut resistant). The Venture is single and also does not appear to be cut resistant. Nevertheless, two is better than one.
Grandson loved wallet but too big to fit in any of his pockets - even front cargo pockets. He wears a size 5T in boys. Wish I knew dimensions when I bought it.
Extremely disappointed in this product. I finally used it traveling this past weekend and it is not very good. I especially wanted a suitor back that I could fold and carry over my shoulder. The snaps to not hold so the suit slips down and bunches up/wrinkles when trying to use the shoulder strap, again, because the snaps do not hold. I personally would not purchase this item knowing what I know now.
We are 2 weeks into the school year and the shoulder strap has ripped off and the adjustable strap frayed. My 9 year old son uses the bookbag just to carry his books to and from school. The bag stays in a cubby during the school day. He picked this bag out himself so he was crushed that we have to trash it 2 weeks after school started.
it fits under seat very well. I love the color and the way it handles. I used it for the first time this past weekend to travel to New Orleans for a few days. I did not over pack or put stress on any of the seams. It tore in the handle compartment. I know it wasn't that much money but I thought I would be able to use it more than once. Very disappointed. I added a picture but not sure if I did it correctly. I do not have the original box or know if there is any type of warranty with this product but wanted to let you know that it did fall apart on first use.
It's oretty but broke the first day I used it
This bag is very attractive, don't get me wrong. It SHOULD be a great buy. However, mine arrived with a broken zipper on the inside pocket. (The zippers are not of a good quality). When the seller reached out to me a few days after I received the bag, I informed them of the broken zipper. Their answer was not to replace the bag or even repair the bag, their answer was to refer me to a YouTube video on home zipper repair. I did try to fix the zipper according to the instructions with no success. The seller again contacted me again about 5 days ago and asked me to give them a five star rating. I again told them about the zipper but they have failed to make things right. I'm not a complainer at all and I hate to run down a retailer but I think everyone should know that this seller is not one of the best. They will not take care of problems that you may run into with their products. Buy from a different seller.
Clip to strap is very flimsy, broke right out of the box.
I bought this for a three day festival and was a little disappointed at how stiff the bag is, it made it kind of hard to use. Not a dealbreaker though, BUT literally on the first day I didnt even make it through the festival gates before the straps (drawstrings) on one side completely ripped off the bag. We stabbed a hole in the bag and tied the strings through the hole, and then melted the stings as they are thick and don't hold a knot well. Used it for that day but bought a clear unicorn childrens backpack at Walmart for the next two days lol
A little bulky and the design is not quite what I expected. One would have to remove the tag and take off the plastic loop in order to open up and read the information inside (it doesn't open easily). This might be good for privacy/safety concerns but a tedious hassle if your baggage were to become lost and someone must figure out how to get it open before they can contact you (meanwhile the tag must be completely removed from your luggage leaving it to become lost again if someone is not careful enough to replace it). The other feature I really don't like is that the card inside is not removable and is basically a shiny sticker inside so if you mess it up, you are stuck with it :(
Meh, seems to have weak construction.
It's really neat and room. Durable material. One month of use and the zipper broke. Disappointed.
didn't work at all upon arrival. return was quick and simple, though.
My girls loved this backpack, however after 1 day back to school, the backpack has a hole in the seam ☹️
Its a Kool bag, buy there was no battery inside the lower part of the bag, as advertised. I wasn't happy about that.
Not the greatest quality for what I paid. packaging and delivery time were fine.
All the giraffes were across the bottom or upside down. Who wants that?
Purchased backpack in November. Was not that impressed. Thought that backpack material felt cheap. My 8 yr old son loved it though. Backpack lasted only a couple weeks and the plastic piece that tightens the straps already broke.
My wife thought this was the cutest little thing she'd seen. She wanted it mainly for the harness and leash. Unfortunately because of the way the straps are designed it doesn't work all that well for that part. The chest buckle is way too low which I didn't notice when I was ordering it. If you were to actually try to use this on a child as a harness it's not very secure and slips way up if they're tugging on it at all. It would have been much better if the chest strap had been adjustable up and down. One idea I had was adding a strap all the way across that attaches to the pack instead of the shoulder pads and comes across under his armpits. But that's a lot of work to make it useable. It's possible maybe he'll grow into it a little better eventually but that doesn't really help me now. It really is cute on him though so if you don't care about the harness it might be worth getting. One other negative is the adjustable part on the shoulder pads isn't hemmed, so when you loosen it, it can come all the way out and you have to rethread it. It's a pretty easy fix to just fold over the fabric and sew it, but it's something that should have already been done.
Cute print however we haven't finished the school year and the inside has ripped.
We loved this backpack at first. Very bright and fun. Zipper broke after 2 weeks of using it and I have a kindergartner so it's not like a lot of stuff is going into it and weighing things down. Super bummed.
Much smaller than looks in pic and now i end up with three luggage of same size
Snap fell apart the first day
It's ripped the day I got it but it holds a lot of things two pairs of size 13 shoes and clothes.
I bought this clear back pack as it had good reviews and the other brand did not last 3 weeks. This one last about 5 or 6 weeks prior to ripping. Our schools require clear backpacks and this one was a disappointment. Will not purchase again....
This was smaller than expected and cheaply made. The print was vibrant though, and the return was easy so that earned two stars.
This bag had a strong odor out of the package. I washed it and had high hopes as the material seems durable and the number of pockets are great. The straps were fraying after 2 weeks of use.
Mine just arrived today. It would be perfect, except it is missing a piece of the zipper in the inside. Very important, as zipper problems are very annoying and time consuming, as anyone knows. Disappointed.
One of the bags got a big hole surprisingly fast.
Cute wallet. The zipper sometimes splits open. I don't know if they all do it or if I just got one that is faulty.
I had this product only less than a year and traveled few times internationally. Things started falling after couple trip. Mostly with the zip. Beginner the zipper handle broke. Then in the last trip the entire zipper torn off and lost some items. Good thing I bought Insurance too. Good thing Amazon replaced without any cost. Hope the new one lasts. If this also breaks apart I wouldn't replace it.
Too small. I wish it they were a little bigger.
Small! I'm not even sure it is big enough for a child.... I was hopeful for a cute and glittery gym bag but I can fit like a shirt, shorts and small hoodie with nothing else! Lol
The watch was arrived broken and the backpack was teared up one side
I used this Luggage 3 times and I have a broken wheel. I would've thought this was a tougher product.
I wanted to love it. I took it out of the box and it looked great. I fit most of my stuff in it for travel. However, it's now dented to hell and back after being handled by the airport, which tells me it isn't very durable. One use and it looks like I've had it for a year.
Did not have this product long before I ran into issues, specifically with the zippers: zipper ripped off of pack allowing items to fall off, came off track, etc. Eventually totally fell off of pack leaving product unusable. Pockets were awkwardly sized/shaped. Will not purchase again.
Got it today. It looks sturdy, fresh & new from inside but bag itself from outside isn't looking fresh & new so my girl isn't happy at all. I'm returning this. black color isn't new & fresh. It looks like an old used/washed bag from outside. I'm disappointed & not happy with the purchase.
Really wanted to like it. Size, shape, look, everything was great. My son was happy when he saw it.. but barely three weeks in it is unusable.
Large suitcase is Great! The medium is just a touch too big to fit as carry on and the small is too small for me
Stopped working after a month of use. I made a mermaid I had alcohol free witch hazel, distilled water, cedarwood, lavender, thyme, and rosemary in the bottle. No citrus or anything that would corrode.
Super cute bag but the strap is too short to wear this as a crossbody bag.. and I'm 5'1”.
Wheels would not always roll easily....pieces have already broken off after using only 3 times... purchased in April 2017... would not recommend!!
I wanted to keep this...it looks like a well made suitcase. But it's just too big for a flight carry-on and, more importantly, I have a bad back...sure, it rolls, but what about when you're not going to roll it and need to travel?
I love this purse I have had it for just over a month now but the zipper broke I don't know how to get it fixed
I like the size. Sholder straps are too short and missing alot of them gems on arrival. Cute design
Strap broke after a couple of weeks.
The reason why i bought these was because I thought they would be completely black. They are not, the mesh/top is a gray color. Apart from that they seem alright and haven't yet tried them out.
Broke after one gust of wind
These were ok. But difficult to use and the zipper kept detaching. Unless you are gonna roll clothes on the floor in your hotel, traveling solo would be difficult. It took my sister and I working together to make them work properly. Ended up recycling them in Europe instead of using them on the return trip.
Used the bag for one week on a cruise as a beach bag and the handles both ripped on one side of the bag. Loved the bag, but do not want to spend $$$ for one week of use.
I had to return my first wallet because the bottom wasn't stitched correctly and then my replacement lasted for only a couple of months before the stitches started giving out on it too. It's a nice wallet and the material seems like it would hold up but the stitching seems to have some issues.
It's really cute but way too small to be used as a backpack, even for pre-school. This photo shows the backpack next to my daughter's lunchbox, for comparison- literally does not even fit a standard size lunch box. It's more like a stuffed animal with a zipper- probably great for carrying a couple diapers and a snack in lieu of a diaper bag, just not ideal for pre-school
did not like...it looked better online than first hand. I wish I could still return it...but I missed my return window time. Bummer. I would imagine the bag is functional...but just not the look of a backpack I was looking for...oh well.
Looks great, but the zipper keeps getting off-track.
I actually really like the design, fit, and feel of this eye mask. Unfortunately, the quality is very poor. After my first one wore out in less than a year, I bought another and hoped it was just a fluke. The second one has also worn out less than a year later. The inner lining peels off from the foam as shown in my picture.
At this price point- I don't expect the best quality bag that will last for years. But I was very disappointed the bag ripped open the very first time I packed it! I stuffed a sleeping bag inside- it was a tight fit, but a very large section split open on the seam. My mom sewed it back up with durable upholstery thread- and I'm hoping I can get at least a few trips out of this duffle before it goes in the trash. We'll see.
Way smaller than advertised
I haven't had it very long and one of the wheels is already broken off. Had to throw it out.
One wheel broke off on first use, I called customer support and was told they don't have the part? Not the kind of company to buy from, very disappointed. The luggage is ok in terms of size and it's light weight.
Got it and for the most part loved it. Except for when the main zipper came out the one end because stitches failed and wouldn't hold it in anymore. Meh. 7 days past the return window so nothing can be done. Would not buy again or recommend.
Unfortunately the spinner is larger than the measurements given. Including wheels and handles and if not completely pressed together it is higher and deeper - more like 22 1/4 inches height and 10 inches or more deep unless it is completely empty and you squeeze it together hard ). I returned it since I could not use it as carry on. It might be a good fit if you are looking for something smallish that you still would o check it in.
Nice but not as how it appears. It is not a metallic gold, more like tan or champagne. Disappointed
Love all the pockets, great use of space, nice and light but enough room for everything needed for business travel. Fabulous that it slips onto the handle of a suitcase! The gold color is already fading in many places and it's been less than 3 months of light use. It looks cheap... rest of bag doesn't. For the brand name I did expect better in that respect. I'm not sure I would be comfortable using in an important business meeting with the fading issue.
Used the portable charger one time and it was able to charge my phone. I went to plug in to charge the portable charger and the little insert piece on it fell out. I am not longer able to use it.
not much give so my laptop did not fit in this bookbag! Beware if you have a large laptop, ensure you measure yours before buying!
Maybe I just don't know how to use em, but I couldn't get them to look nice, placement was difficult.
It's the perfect travel wallet - or it would be - if it didn't look and feel like plastic. It's shiny & cheap looking, like a little girl's plastic purse. It had great reviews & was recommended by many, but I'll never use it; I'd be embarrassed. Too bad, because the design is great.
Update February 23rd 2018. One of my TSA locks has lost its programme, not really sure why but I'm glad I checked it before I decided to pack up on my journey. One thing I like about these programmable locks is the fact that they're easy to program and I can set the combinations of various combinations of my choosing that's one of the reason why I enjoy this product so much. I have to give this a five-star for the reason being able to easily program the device and its durability and sturdiness.
Snapped after only a couple of uses
I bought the bag for a trip. When I got to the hotel, there was a rip in the side.
Did not come with the strap!!!
sent wrong product :/
broke the first day my husband used it. Looks cool, but not well made.
This bag is very small, and if you put your school supplies in it and hold it by the handle the handle will break, also the straps that you adjust the armholes for the ends are too small for the buckle so they slip through and you bag falls off
the larger bag was not stable and kept falling over when we tried to stand it up and the smaller one kept coming unzipped from day one. We did not over pack it so that wasn't the issue. Only used for 1 trip. Would return if I could.
Strap broke while I was out of country. I was not rough with it and it never had more than maybe 20lbs of things in it(iPad battery backup, sunscreen,asprin.... Of course when I got home I found out I was 1 day outside my return window. So now I am stuck with a defect. Till the top loop broke, or really it's more like the stitching just let go, it workes well for my needs. That's why it gets 2 stars not one. It is perfect right up till it comes apart.
Really liked the look and size of this pack. Love that there isn't a ton of wacky colors or huge noticeable logos. It was a great quality bag, not cheaply made. Sturdy zipper and clips to secure the zippers. The only big problem is the straps. They are really nicely designed, the way you shorten/elongate the straps goes up through the straps up by your shoulders instead of down by your waist, so you pull by your shoulders to make it shorter. The BIG PROBLEM is the straps are exceptionally long and made it unusable. I'm a 5'7" female and at the very shortest it was hanging on my bum. You can't even force the rest of the strap up through the plastic holder because the seam is too fat to go though. There is a waist strap but that would just awkwardly hold the bag at the waist while the top pulls away. If the straps fit or could be adjusted I would have kept it for sure. I tried and tried to get it shorter.
When we first got the back I loved the material and zippers. The first month the snack bag on the front broke off. The nylon clip unraveled. I needed to wash it yesterday because a drink spilled inside. This made the front peel and it was on a gentle cycle and no dryer.
Its ok but very flimsy. Doesn't hold enough. If I had another one then I would have enough room for everything
Two weeks after starting to use it, the fabric started to tall apart. I had ti fixed, and once again, it started to break. Unfortunate choice. I wasted my money!
Zipper broke after a few weeks
Just a bit too weak. The first day, I thought it was because they only had a few hours to "soak up the sun," but after a whole sun shine filled day 2, they are no brighter.
I returned product after one round trip flight. Bag was pretty banged up looking after only one trip. I can't imaging how bad it would look after a few years. I bailed and returned it.
Back area near where the handle is attached took heavy damage on first flight, needs better\thicker material. Wouldn't purchase again and wish I would have spent more on something better. Fine option for car only travel, but won't stand up to the abuse of baggage handling on flights.
Not what I expected ... but I gave it as a gift
Was broken from plastic parts after 2 weeks
Should've used the money I spent on a more durable bag. The arm strap is incredibly cheap & broke my second time using it. However, like that it's foldable
This is very cute. However, it does not hold up. A few stitches popped within the first week but it did not impact the use of the backpack. In the third week of gentle use, the entire strap ripped and rendered the bag unusable.
Very useful on traveling. The only problem is my I phone 6 plus is sticking out where you put it!
Great size purse but the straps are not well made.
Case had all the features I wanted, but the zippers were difficult to operate and two of the rivets came off within the first few minutes of handling.
Survived only 1 month worth of use. Ripped and zippers broke relatively easy.
My teenage son is required to have a clear backpack for school. It only lasted for a week. The strap broke as he was trying to put it on. Luckily it's reasonable priced so I can purchase another. Hopefully it will last longer!
...or I can't figure out how to lock them. I wish I could return this suitcase but it's been too long. I am always afraid that if I am on an incline the suitcase will roll away. The zipper also brock but I was able to get it back on track. I did not expect to have these problems with such a pricey (for me) piece of luggage. Next time I'm going to Kohl's.
Zipper was broken. Please send replacement, unable to contact seller directly, no given option
It's poorly make in my opinion. Not sturdy. Was hoping for a leather feel. This is not what I wanted
The item is too small for a man to use and the material was not jute...but felt like plastic bags crochet together.
Just too thick to wear under clothing while traveling. Returns impossible.
The wallet itself is okay. However, the inside fabric rubs off on my cards, and has turned most of my cards red. I think it's a great area of improvement given the main purpose of the wallet.
No stars given. Was not described properly. So small that a man could not even get his fingers into it. I will return this item and ask for a refund as soon as possible. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain my disappointment.
I bought this for work. We need a clear bag at Amazon. All I have in it is a small ziplock bag with gum, hard candy and advil. The top has already ripped where the string is.
It's slippery plastic bed so I had trouble moving a plastic fold up table across the street. The elastic strap is good for a suitcase but the table was too tall. Keeping it for our trip to Vegas when we win the Lottery.
It didn't last for me, I used it once then holder came off
I gave two stars because they're aesthetically beautiful, however they are very poor quality. In only two flights, they were broken. I would not buy them again
Bag was too big to get on an American Airlines flight, had to have it checked while boarding - never will use this bag again. The pull handle is terrible - won't pull out if the bag is fairly full. Wheels don't work on carpeting, have to resort to two wheel pull. Disappointed with this purchase.
Upon recieving this, the handle was bent. Unusual since the package was in tact.
I love the suitcase but unfortunately the handle does not pull out without a fight. I've only used it twice and I have to fight and giggle it to get it to work. I need to reach out to the manufacturer for solutions. I am keeping my fingers crossed that there is one.
Very small and not sturdy. Especially for the price.
Just used it today and the handle is cracked. Not worth returning.
Wheels only work on the best of hard flooring. Carpet is a big fat negative. What are airport floors mostly made of? Carpet. Returning.
Did not come with a case as shown
This was a gift for my husband. At first it was great and looked really nice. One month later it is falling apart and some of the hardware is broken. Not worth the money.
Worked well for a short while but the zipper always had issues and would come open even while zipped shut. And finally, the zipper came completely off one of the tracks and will no longer work. I would not recommend paying more than $25 for this bag.
Bag was useful on our trip, though right from opening up the clip on front that fastens the bag to the front of your chest was not attached when I had received it. A friend of mine that has a previous model of this bag told me it was suppoed to come attached already and that's why I couldn't use that part of it. Rest of the bag held up well on our 1st trip
When I first looked at the wallet, it looked nice. I went to put all my cards and money into and went I tried to zipper the change pocket closed it kept getting stuck. This was a reoccurring problem. Eventually the whole zipper fell off and now I can't use it anymore. I can still use the part that buttons close but I prefer not to since I don't have a place to put my change now.
I am a skinny guy, but even with having the waistband at max length, it still was pressing super hard into my side. Not for me.
This backpack was so cute. Very soft . But too small. My daughter is a tall almost 4 year old and it was just too small. I would like to return. If not maybe I can give it away. It it cute just not what I was looking for.
Love the idea and concept of this bag. But the stitches were done pretty bad. Took this on my trip and the seams came off after first use. Tried contacting the company and they told me to get someone to stitch it back and gave me $5 refund. So much for the warranty and etc that they claimed.
Item was damaged inside of the box outside packaging in tact See photos
I really like this suitcase however, it came wih no instructions on how to work the lock/combination and no key was included. I haven't even used it, somehow it got locked and I can't unlock it! I can't find a way to contact the seller at this point.
The lunch box wasn't insulated kind of small
Purchased this for my teenage son because he doesn't need anything huge, we don't travel a whole lot. It looks decent size in the picture, it's not. I already set up for a return the same day I received it. It wouldn't hold half of his things, I would purchase it for a toddler or if you're not needing to pack too many things, it would be good as a small carry on. It does have a lock but I couldn't get the key to unlock it.
Terrible material very cheap and would start to tear and the handles will start to wear off very early on.
Love the color and the spacious interior; however, 1 use later and it's falling apart inside. No phone number to contact? I submitted a question but can't see a response and would really like to use my “two year warranty”.
This wallet is not real leather. Very stiff hard to use Disappointed.
I bought item for a 9.1 total bottom (to meet airlines requirement) and got a 9.1 platform and a total 12.1 bottom (this included wheel area and handles). A drawn diagram with dimensions and arrows and all that jazz would have been helpful; always is when the English language fails.
Overall great bag, only downside is that I had 2 zippers broke the very first time I went to use the bag without even having anything inside.
The bar isn't sturdy at all. I'll be returning this item
I should've just spent the money for something more expensive. The water bottle leaks terrible and nothing but a sandwich and chips fit in the lunchbox. My son spilled juice twice in a week in the backpack portion and it was impossible to get clean. Most backpacks can just be washed or wiped out. Not impressed. I gave 2 stars bc it's a cute design and did come with a lot...it was just all cheap.
It was fine for the most part, but it leaked from the center and after a year, It was broken.
My husband works for the railroad, and wanted a lunch box he didn't have to carry. So we thought this backpack would be great! He wore it for about a month, and the seam started ripping. Of course the return window is one month, so I contacted Amazon and they were able to replace it! Great. So We get the new one probably first week in May, as of today June 4th, again, the seam is ripping in the same place. He isn't rough with it, he wears it, puts it down, wears it. Nothing crazy. All & all I would think twice about ordering this backpack. But, if you only need a backpack to last you a month, then this is the one for you.
I bought 4 sets of the same luggage in each set one suite case has a damage wheel . in one of them the zipper broke. Not recommended. I will contact the manufacture as it has 2 year warranty but will never buy this again.
Messed up my pants, cause of the hard shell. The elastic wears out , loses tension too fast.
The wallet is definitely streamlined, however, the stitching for the pull tab has already come loose after 2 weeks. This was one of the main reasons I chose this wallet for the easy access to my cards via pull tab.
Umbrella did not last very long. Seems to only withstand minimal wind.
The umbrella works nice; however, I received a warped/ bent handle. I don't know if this is a manufacturing defect or if it was bent in the shipping process. It is large and deep enough to share with one other person. I have gotten complements on the esthetics as well.
Beautiful color, texture, and great features: exterior pocket, great organizational compartments, detachable laptop pouch, spacious, BUT as soon as I removed it from the packaging I noticed a MAJOR problem-it will not stand up! The bag tips over and crashes! After packing it with the typical items I carry in a trolley, invariably it STILL crashes--this is ANNOYING. To add insult to injury, when I attempted to zip the bag closed, the hardware came off! REALLY??!!
While good in theory, the idea of compressing to fit more in a suit case is appealing. However, when using the cubes I wasn't able to fit as much in my suitcase as usual and there was a lot of wasted space around the cubes. I ended up not using them and packing as normal so that I could fit in everything I needed.
One of the clasps broke after using it a few times
What advertised was not received. Insist of receiving the cinch sack a carabiner was part of the 5pc set
It was small for the suitcase I bought
My clothes arrived at my destination wrinkled as if I had stuffed them into a gym bag. Did not do the job of a real garment bag. Looked ingenious, but I am not satisfied with the performance at all.
Quality not as expected ..fabric not soft
I got these with the intent to compress my clothes to fit in a backpack. I folded different ways and tried rolling and rearranging, but it just doesn't actually compress. The edges pinch down with some struggles with the zipper getting caught, but the middle is still the same thickness. It went down maybe a centimeter. As packing cubes they are good, and I would recommend them. I will be returning them though because I need compression.
This is a good quality wallet, and I was very pleased at first. However two of my credit cards now have trouble in chip readers. Also I have had several hotel keys and parking lot tickets demagnetized if I forget not to put them in the same pocket. It's too much of a hassle. I'm going to replace this with a similar wallet with a different clip than a magnetic one.
I like this design. I didn't like that the pegs are short and it falls over easily.
I was hesitant to purchase this set without reviews, but I, like others, was enticed by the Black Friday deal. If you are looking for a disposable set of luggage, this is it. The quality is equivalent to what's offered at your local discount store. The wheels are all plastic. The extended handle flexes a lot and the release button is sensitive so that the handle keeps retracting while you're wheeling through the airport. I've used the smaller bag as a carry on for a very short trip and it's already nicely scratched and dinged from a fall on the pavement. My guess is that rough handling by baggage check will likely be enough to break this set. On the positive side, the amount of storage is nice and the smaller bag held a weekend worth of clothes nicely with space to spare. The bag also fit well into the overhead compartment, but note that the smaller bag has no side handle - which I missed when lifting and lowering the bag. If you see this set for the Black Friday price again, consider it a maybe. But I definitely would not pay MSRP for this set. You can find much higher quality sets out there for the same price.
smaller than what I expected. I had to order a bigger bag
When the description says it can withstand winds up to 70 mph, one would think it could with stand winds of about 30... Nope. The whole thing flipped inside out and broke. Cool...
The reason for the two stars - I didn't like the fact that the strap cannot be made smaller to fit your waist. That needs to be addressed in the design because it currently hangs way too low because I cannot tighten the strap to fit.
No it ripped the same day I got it , I want another one.
This is a really nice looking bad but unfortunately after the third time I wore it and only putting papers inside like my license and some cash the bottom strap just broke off.
I replaced my old one that I had for a long time. This one lasted less then 2 weeks before zipper pulled off broken.
I love that my nephew enjoys the backpack however the lunch box doesn't fit a normal packed lunch. The price was not worth the cheap water bottle the too small lunchbox I found the exact one for $14.99 at Walmart online shopping
I's too hard to put on. It's uncomfortable to wear once it's on. It's too difficult to use once it's on. I almost had to take it off to retrieve what I put in it, e.g. money, passport
While the suitcases lasted, they were nice! Lightweight structure, decent interior, moved easily. Unfortunately, I got to enjoy these for all of an hour before they began to fall apart. Wheel came off, leaving the largest one rendered useless while we were half-way across the country. Not reliable, yet they are pretty. Note weights of each [packed] suitcase during their first (and last) trip: Large - 38 pounds Medium - 30 pounds Small - 17 pounds
The wallet was ok. My main problem with it, it is not genuine leather the main body of it made from vinyl or something. Some places are made of leather. Very disappointing.
The pillow feels comfortable, but out of the box already has a sizable hole that could get bigger with use. Overall after use, the memory foam in this product is too firm to make for a comfortable rest on an airplane. I would recommend spending more on a better product than buying this. Arguably, this product is only good if you consider yourself to have a long neck that could utilize the extra firm and bulky padding.
This is so cute however it is super super tiny with a very short strap would never work for the seven-year-old I bought it for and is way overpriced I'll be sending it back.
The straps tore (shredded) on the top/back. The plastic on the bottom crumbled and the bottom began to tear also. The heaviest thing I carried in it was a water bottle, the rest was simply papers and a small note pad and a few pens and my lunch, which was usually just a baggie with chips and a sandwich.
Bags arrived with broken zipper and plastic detached from zipper. No time to return them before my travels, disappointed.
The zipper on your front compartment bag is coming apart. I'm no longer able to use that compartment because of the zipper malfunction. I would like to turn return this item and purchase the same bag with a good zipper.
I ended up returning this bag for credit. While there was nothing wrong with the quality, it turned out to be too small.
Great size and a lot of pockets unfortunately the quality not so good. It got ripped after the first use.
I bought this in early February and it is now late April. Loved it when I bought it. I have flown with it about 4 times (the mid-size). The plastic finish is peeling off, the zipper is broken, and a wheel is broken. Im very disappointed as it had great reviews, is attractive, and started out so nice. Likely great if traveling by car and self handling but falling apart after only four flights. :(. Very disappointed.
The odor was very strong. I aired it outside. I still haven't used it but after 5 month it doesn't smell it so I can use it
Loved the suitcase but it didn't fit in the carry on container at the airport!!! I bought it specifically to use as a carry on and I was told by United, Belgium airlines, and TAP airlines that I had to check because of the size. Great suitcase if you don't mind checking the bag, but if you wanna use it as a carry on it doesn't fit
I had an issue with the bag and they sent me another that is in great condition immediately!
Note that they are not a full circle. The back is flat. I didn't realize that before purchasing. Therefore they were much smaller than anticipated. Also, when they arrived they were much smaller from being condensed in the package. It took about 15 minutes for them to fully puff up to size.
Very cute (present for my 9 year-old as she gets ready for middle school). Unfortunately, however, there were only 2 instead of 3 bags included, but seller kindly apologized for this inconvenience and said they will send it immediately)
Came without the removable shoulder strap
I actually thought it was a pack of two--too pricey for one luggage tag. well made and sturdy though
Just got it. Seems decent quality and will do what I need. Only issue at the moment is I ordered the blue color and they sent me beige. About to go on a big trip don't really have the time to switch out.
So far in the quality is halfway decent. However the little bags you put them in our of no use to me! I wish you would have put the extra quality and cost into the bags themselves. Rather than adding a little carry your bags.
It was pretty good! The problem I have is I ordered a big size and it was still small can we please get another one if you guys have a larger size than big
I love this purse however I have only had it 2 month and the zipper teeth do not grab to close despite no teeth being broken and little use it is so disappointing because this is a beautiful bag. Window for return is closed and too expensive for price of bag to repair
It's leather, but a bit thinner than I expected.. coloring was also a bit off! Other than that, it Seems to be working well so far.
Very nice, well made but too large to us.
Bought it for my wife's suitcase
So cute- but the zipper is already getting stuck after just a few months-
I loved this product. It was perfect for what I needed, but the zipper is very poor quality. It was hard to close and felt like it was going to break at any moment.
Like the first pair, although only one made it home on an international trip. Assumed TSA screwed up. Bought these and again, one went missing on the first leg of the trip. TSA?? Can they come open on their own??? I'd love to blame TSA, but there was no inspection note in the bad either time. I'm puzzled.
The fact that I can carry a few CC's, DL and money together in one place is great; however it would be better if it was shorter in length. I don't understand why it has to be so long? The whole idea was for me to get away from carrying a wallet, I use to stick a couple of cards and cash in my front pocket and go. The clip is not as comfortable in my front pocket as I thought it would be.
Did not like this wallet . Too thick an hard to slip into back pocket.
The bag is ok. Meets my needs for size and pockets. Should have added a handle on top of bag. This would make the bag easier to pick up and handle before using the shoulder strap.
I ordered this bag as a large. When I got it, it was smaller than expected. I took the tags off and began using it, so it was too late when I realized it had a logo on it and was a medium. On the page, it says they don't have any mediums left in stock for this design. I'm very disappointed in this issue and the fact that I paid more for a large, and received something smaller. The bag is very nice quality and I love how it looks, so I would've given it five stars had it not been for that issue.
Solid bag but the zippers can easily get jammed on the fabric zipper cover that covers the zipper track. Not sure if these were added for cosmetic purposes but it can really be a pain.
Size too big and thick.
This bag is really cute and is great size to carry all I need. But I have only had it for a week and the stitching on the handle inside front pocket is already coming out.
I have just one complaint and it's a pretty big one: The bag, at its smallest, is too large to be worn around my waist. I'm 5 ft. 6, around 120 lbs, a size two. I'm pretty much just like the woman in the photo, so I wonder if they pinched the bag in the bag behind her in order to make it fit. The straps are definitely at their smallest, no question there. It's about 4 inches too big for my waist, and if I take one step, the whole bag falls to the floor. So I have to decide whether to return it or keep it as a crossbody bag only. I do like the bag otherwise very much...but I have several crossbody bags and bought this one so I could wear it around the waist during our travels.
I purchased this for its cooling properties for a long distance trip, however, it only stayed cool for about 5 minutes, and I had to remove it often to re cool it. It was also quite bulky and more difficult to transport than inflatable pillows.
We spent the week at Disney so we were in and out of the backpack several times a day. Midway through the week the zipper became a problem. You had to hold it just right to get it closed. The front zipper at one time wouldn't close at all. After messing with it several times it closed. If the zippers worked better I would of given it a higher rating.
Inside the bag is tearing already
The quality is ok and expected for this price. The problem are the wings. They came squished and I haven't be able to fix them to look like how they are in the picture on here. I just whish they could find a better way to send the product without deforming it.
My daughter LOVED the print but it was too small since she is now a kindergartener. Definitely ordered wrong this time and sent it back.
Product is good delivery was another thing They delivered to wrong house
I love the idea of this bag, but the material is very floppy. I mean the bag does not stand up on its own. I'm going to purchase one of those purse organizers hoping it helps the issue. Other than that I'm pleased with the purchase.
I got this bag and loved it that I also got the matching wallet. I had the bag for just about a month and used it lightly and it ripped! The whole strap came off, not only did the stitching fall apart on my bag, I check the second strap and noticed that it was also undoing. I'm assuming my bag was made poorly because a friend also got the same bag and used it lightly and hasn't had an issue. Also a part from the string popped off. I also reach out to the company hoping they would replace the bag being that I had just a little over 30 days and no one has returned my emails. Therefore I am very unsatisfied with my purchases and experience.
I received my order on time and was very excited but when I opened the package it was BLUE!! and NOT magenta. I'm very upset because I have a trip coming up in a couple of days and I needed this suitcase but this blue is so fugly I'm returning it immediately.
I was excited to get this item, however when I put my size C cup bras in it, they clearly don't fit. I think this item was made for smaller size bras. With three bras awkwardly smashed into it, there is no room to fill the laundry bag that comes velcro attached inside. Sadly the zipper is very cheap.
I could shove in 8 passports, but I couldn't comfortably close the wallet with so much bulk inside. If you don't actually need to keep 8 passports regularly, this could be useful. I returned mine since I need to carry 7 passports while travelling, and this isn't cutting it.
Cute imitation, but I don't think it will last long. A bit bulky too.
Made from poor guality material , the mid size bag ruptured on first usage causing loss of material that it was carrying. No complaints with the other two.
More convenient than usual carryon because with so little legroom on usual flights it's hard to get anything out of a horizontal bag. Things are more accessible with this vertical shape, and it slides easily under the seat. Unfortunately, this is poorly made. I used it for the first time and the handle came apart. I thought the screw holding the top part could be tightened, but the hole for the screw was no longer intact across the top. The only solution was to wrap electrician's tape around the handle. I wound up tipping the bus driver who fixed it more than I paid for the bag.
Waterproof? Maybe, but will stain if it gets wet
Cheap cheap cheap. Zipper broke within the first week. The material on the back side ripped the first time we put a hanger in.
I loved the look but did not hold up well for airline travel. Got scratches and scuff marks. Would not recommend for air travel.
Strap broke but I fixed it with tape and a carabiner clip
I love the color, and all the different sizes, but the material is a little cheaper than I thought.
It's a beautiful bag but about less than a week after purchasing, the zipper broke. Also, I found that a seller on Etsy is selling these for $20 a piece 😳
I do love it but it could have been just a little bigger around. I'm a small woman so it wasn't too bad but the bottom of my jacket does get wet and if the wind blows only the part under the dome stays dry. But I love that it goes over my face I just wish it was a little bigger around.
Putting my phone in messed up the zipper. And my phone is pretty thin and light...
I like the size and style of the wallet. The different compartments was what I was looking for. I do wish it was made out of a little nicer material and the strap was a little sturdier.
The internal storage could be more flexible but overall the product is what I hoped it would be.
This bag was much larger than the description. The opening was not wide enough to fit over the suitcase handle.
Stitching is poorly done. Otherwise great for travel bag
Nice size, bought for grandson for short trips
Bought it to use on a trip. Basically, it could only carry my phone (iphone 7 plus with a case on) and my car keys (just the keys without any keychains) comfortably. I wish I paid more attention to the reviews but I based my purchase on the pictures I saw. Space is compact but I did like the function of a zipper pocket on the back.
I bought this as an accessory for a costume, for which it worked well! It also was great for shielding me from the sun. However I recently took it out in a rainstorm and was surprised to look up and see...rain...coming through the fabric of the umbrella. An umbrella that lets in rain just can't be called a five star umbrella. I do love how large it is...just wish it could keep me dry.
Nice bag buy very small. Just big enough to fit a tablet.
Good idea..too short. Will fit only at the width..
Nice case, good quality, but yes, too big for take on on some airlines (domestic AND international)
I purchase the rolling backpack, the pencil case and the lunchbag, all "Aloha" color. I love the dimensions of the products, the only setback was that the lunchbag's pink color was a lot lighter, and didn't match with the backpack.
I wanted to love these, but they are far too small for practical use. The only clothes they're really good for are bathing suits and t-shirts. Anything that isn't super thin material is going to be too big to fit.
The small cubes are very small, and the large cube isn't very large. I would I have bought a different set if I had realized how the sizes translated to reality. Well made product.
I lost one in transition. I guess the handle did not hold up.
Little bit small for me :/
The backpack is awesome!! Fits books and soccer stuff for our 6th grader who is on the soccer team. Big minus is that the zipper for the section where the ball is supposed to be gets stuck to the point that you cannot open it.
I've had this backpack for about 9 months now. It's really cute and I still get compliments but there are a couple of problems. Within the first couple of months the two buttons that secured the straps on the flap of the backpack to the front both broke off. This problem isn't too bad to deal with except for when it gets windy enough. Then if the wind is blowing in the right direction, the flap will fly up and hit me in the head. The other problem is that after a couple of months, one of the zippers on the main pocket broke. This problem is minor since I still have the second zipper on that pocket that works. I still use this backpack regularly but will probably be getting a different one soon because I don't want to deal with the flap attacking me anymore.
The locks on the front are kind of cheap.
First trip went to Jamaica. Handle broke on two of them. Airline folks are ruff on luggage.
I liked these, but one of the 4 did not work. Otherwise, good product.
Looked good at first. Husband has been carrying for 1-2 months and looks very used. Hoping it holds up as long as last one (2 years).
The bag looks really pretty but...it's not strong I had it for three weeks and it had fallen apart, I have read the reviewed and it draw my attention, so that is why I purchased it but now I am regretting it... or maybe I just the faulty one...
Smaller than typical airline carry on. I'm sure if I had bothered to measure I would have known this. Just a caveat for those who are purchasing it for airline use. One change of clothes a few personal items is about it.
more like clutch purse/wallet quality is good and color is great packaged well and fast shipping
The backpack opens in the back and not the front..
Really pretty backpack but, it's pretty awkward to put my laptop in or get it out. I also wish the side pockets outside were bigger or stretchy because you can't fit a water bottle (idk how they put the soda drink in there in the picture) I think the only thing u can fit in there is a phone or a really slim umbrella. I like the pockets inside tho I can put some extra stuff I couldn't with my last backpack.
No the quality I anticipated
Has more pockets for credit cards than needed or comfortable to wear. Had to cut center holder out so it would fit in my pocket and not hurt hip when sitting.
Side pockets broke within a month.
i bought this backpack to take with me to a music festival. it worked really great until the end when the zippers on the front, smaller pocket broke! i was able to fix it on my own the next day, but i am also not surprised it happened since this product is very affordable.
Reviews are right, GREAT is packed full...love the two levels ...but leave a little room and it flops all over and even opening it becomes difficult. was sorry as the design idea is great but leaves a lot to be desired in practice
Zipper is hard to close and open.
I love the bag but after only a few months, the snap came off so now I can only close one side.
Will meet the need, but will another to replace it soon
This bag is HUGE. There was really no need for such large luggage, but the size isn't the issue. This bag started falling apart after two flights, so it's not the best quality.
The cup holder itself is difficult to use with a can and with a smaller cup it does not work well.
Couldn't keep. The red is not red at all. Pink with shiny straps. Ordered for a boy. Definitely will not work.
got this for my gf's 5.5 year old who loves Mario. It's sized just right for him now but is kind of tiny. the handle has a picture of Mario on one side and Luigi on the other. the picture of Mario is already scraping off after only having the umbrella for a couple of days. there's also no reason why this is listed as "for girls" it is absolutely unisex.
Like the print, but had to return it as this pack was too small.
Worked great until TSA broke it.
KINDA SMALL BUT ITS OK.AFTER 1ST USE THE STITCHES AT BOTTOM RIPPED . HAD TO TAKE A LOSS AND THROW IT AWAY DUE TO TIME ON RETURNING HAS EXPIRED .
Item was not the best quality, zipper broke shortly after use. Seller has good customer service, has offered to resolve.
You get what you pay for. Not so good quality.
I like the luggage tags and they seem pretty sturdy. My only complaint is we can't use one of the hooks because there is no way to screw it together. Now I have to buy additional hooks. Ugh! So double check your hooks...
This thing is enormous, way bigger than I though it was going to be.
I really really wanted to like this but the side zipper pockets are practically unusable if you use the side water bottle pockets. It's either or but not both.
My cherub loves this umbrella. Unfortunately, the purple u-part of the handle broke off within 2 uses. Popped it back on and hoping for the best. But can't rate higher for that reason.
Not the best quality. I returned.
They lock well but fold and buckle in some not very useful ways. I continue to use these occasionally but will seek better alternatives. I don't think the canvas webbing they use is up to the task. Also, it appears that you can loosen these when they are locked, which undercuts the point of using them quite a bit
Price was decent; it is thin, fairly attractive looking though not particularly robust in construction. However, it does not block RFID. Many wallets that are advertised as RFID protective are not.
I loved this bag when I saw it, however after the first plane trip the plastic strip in the middle on the bottom broke. When we returned from the same trip, one of the side pockets had been almost ripped off. I know the airlines through bags around but was disappointed that this didn't keep together as well as I thought it would. It's a great size and holds everything you need. I also did not exceed the weight limit the airlines have.
It looked very cute and fancy on the page but when I got it looked ugly. The glitters looked like someone just put a bunch of clear blue and threw glitter on top in a very sloppy way
Ok quality, but somewhat flimsy. Does not compare to the other set I bought from another company. Plastic pulls popped off zippers within 2 uses.
It is very nice but it's not as spacious as i thought, over all it is a nice backpack
They're OK but a little difficult to attach to bag. They'd be fine if you were doing this at home but trying to wrangle laptop bag and secure without the little cords popping off while trying to get through the airport is a bit more of a chore than I expected. They're just OK, not great. Learning curve to figure it out the first time; be patient and reread the limited directions and poor pictures.
It's too deep for a purse but not big enough to use for school
Perfect for fitting under seat. Quality a little disappointing.
The main reason I marked a 3 is because the front pocket is a fake pocket. I was planning on putting my phone in the pocket as a quick on-the-go spot, but it is only half an inch deep (about enough room to put a pen in it LOL). The leather straps are a bit cheap but have not broken yet since I bought this two months ago (although I fear they will start to fray). The inside organization (two sections and one zippered pocket and one open pocket) is great. I use the removable zippered pouch for my battery.
i love the bag itself, but it's not as big as the picture made it seem
Straps are too short even with extending them. The top of the straps are too close to center so they end up rubbing against your neck. The size and bright red color are great. The plastic is very thick which is good so won't tear easily
Ripped on the first use
Looks really cheap, cheaper than expected honestly, wish it was better made. Thanks
Zippers broke after a couple weeks. Strap length moves around and needs adjusting with each wear.
Looks more nicer in the pic
There were no instructions included for the combination lock after trying to figure it out I found instructions on amazon however now I can't tell if I've reset the combination so for fear of not being able to unlock I'm not using the lock which is one of the reasons I purchased this backpack
Completely forgot to review! Really loved this bag outside of the fact that it had a stain on it. I ordered the yellow one and it's a beautiful color. Just wish it wasn't stained! Hopefully it'll come out in the wash though. Will update.
The inside of the bag is really soft and tears easily
It's very durable and cute, just small.
The design is good but it looks very cheaply made!! The design is great as a travel backpack but the zippers are hard to open and close. Especially the main top zipper which gets stuck every time I want to close it back up!! Would not buy ever again..
The three sizes are excellent for various sized bags you may have from a small purse to a rucksack back pack. Also great for security bag checks either at airports or a sports stadium entrance. However the construction is not sturdy enough for even the simple airplane travel. The zipper is too small & will often get caught in the folds of the vinyl . My large compartment was used to hold travel necessities like hand sanitizer, pocket tissues, etc but the vinyl tore after a couple of plane trips. Still useful to have the other two just done expect a fully durable solution
I happily use packing cubes. Curious about these type of folders, I ordered this brand as I thought the Eagle Creek ones were way overpriced especially considering I wasn't sure about using them and they also add a bit of weight. These folders arrived and while they are not tailored as elegantly as the Eagle Creek, I think they are sufficient as well as more economical. However, I had to file each plastic folding board ALL THE WAY around. The edges of every board WITHOUT EXCEPTION were not smooth. This would not be a concern with basic attire but the rough edges would catch on silky garments. I will probably keep a set for my husband and a set for myself as I am very curious to see if they are as helpful as everyone says they are.
Very dirt attracting and the seams look like they are falling out slowly but I love the pocket space.
Could only give 3 stars as couldn't be sure it would really fit under the seat of the plane easily.
The backpack was to just to small. It wouldn't hold books and a medium size three ring binder. It didn't fit as well as I expected, even after adjusting the straps, it still hit to high on my daughter's back. It did seem durable if you were using it for small items and only a few things.
Will not fit my 16 " 5/8 lap top I purchased it because one of the question was asked if it would fit a 17" lap top and the answer was yes , wrong it will not fit.
I returned this bag. The small outer pocket on the front was too small to fit my iPhone XR and the zipper stuck so it wouldn't zip up. The pockets on the side were too small to hold anything. However, I did like that the zipper on the main compartment opened up big and for such a small bag, it was pretty roomy.
The charger portal is kinda pointless because both ends are just USB portals.
It is very big to take to the office. It is good for a weekend getaway.
Cute coin purse but the pattern is mostly upside down which is a little weird. But for the cost it is well made and I still like it.
looks cheap just not what i expected
Nice backpack but only one zipper works. I would return it but I don't have time to wait for another to come in.
This umbrella was fantastic at filtering the 110 degree AZ heat. It kept me from getting sunburned and also reduced the amount of heat coming through. However, it broke after one week of use. Returning it as a defective product. :(
A little small. But well made and still works for what I need
Cute but very stiff and cheap quality, however it was very inexpensive
It's a nice backpack, but it's not very roomy. There are a lot of different pockets inside, but the actual body of the inside is super small. Hard to even fit a small jacket in there with anything else. I do really like that it can hold my 42oz hydroflask though! Overall it's okay...durable, just like you would expect from a Jansport, but considering the overall size of it, the lack of space is disappointing. You basically have a giant backpack, with only enough room to carry a little bit. Not really worth the price paid. Get a regular sized Jansport, more room, and half the price.
Tags and nice and solid. Should last. Unfortunately only 1 blank tag came with the 2 tags.
I ordered these to travel with and ended up when my young grandkids saw them they loved having their drinks of water from them. ( They did colapse too easily) So fascinated with how they can colapse and pull back up. We have not been able to use the largest one because there is a place on the top of the rim where it is jagged therefore not safe to use. I had not checked the whole set thoroughly and the time had passed where it was too late to return back to Amazon. Wish that there was a way to replace the large one.. Thanks.
US passport fits, but its really tight, and other slightly larger passports from europe or other countries dont fit... real shame...
after having this for a while the logo on the front ripped in half, not a very good material. didn't use the backpack for much.
I've got 2 different covers , while I ordered same .. One of the covers is loose and has only 1 strip while the other one is fit and has 2 strips to close it ..
I was a little disappointed with this backpack ....I really really loved the design, color and quality looks great, but I bought it for my laptop (this is described as a laptop backpack) and it doesn't have a laptop sleeve or some protective pocket for it....so I had to buy a laptop sleeve separatly for when I want to carry it in this back pack, also the "back pocket" its just a zipper that opens to the interior of the back pack, totally useless.
This would have worked if I was a single gal but I'm a mom of 3 kids, and this bad was just to small. It came on time nothing bad there and I guess it would have worked for a while until it ripped from excessive use lol. I was hoping the drink carrier was bit bigger but it fits standard water bottles I drink a lot of water everyday and my water bottles are not plastic they are glass so they didn't fit.... So in my closet it will remain until my daughter finds it or a friend wants it.
I ordered Gray and was sent Black. Unfortunately I leave for Vegas in 3 Days and I do not have the time to deal with this.
The tag itself is well made, however I am having difficulty with attaching the plastic coated wire. I think it should be longer and the locking mechanism to hold it in place is not fool proof. If you are not able to get the end pieces in exactly the right place the lock will not hold and can easily be pulled apart.
wanted to like these locks ... however TSA had to cut the locks off my bags as they jammed and where unable to be opened by the agents.
Too big & Heavy for me...also didn't like the zipper. Gave to my daughter as it's very good quality and appears well made.
Great looking lightweight bag. Liner began ripping after ~6 months of use and exterior corner wore through after ~9 months. If you want something functional and fashionable that probably won't last more than a year of everyday use, this is worth considering.
Smaller then i thought
Money clip is super tight which is great but the quality isn't that great, 3/5 stars
We used the suitcases for 3 vacations the last was a ocean cruise the zipper broke and we were stuck having to get a replacement on the ship the zipper should have lasted longer than 3 short vacation
Very classy looking but can't put anything in the side pockets it tilts forward and falls over berry light too the wheels however you have to push sideways before rolling it
This suitcase is fine for overhead storage and easy to lift and put on top of a bigger suitcase but it does not (as advertised) fit under the first and second seat of an airplane. It will go under the window seat but it sticks out and there is no leg room. I wish I'd gotten the smaller one and ask Amazon NOT to advertise it as an under seat bad. The zippers are a bit stiff and difficult but that may improve with time. The handle is a bit wobbly, which didn't track well down the aisle of the plane. It was fine everywhere else.
This backpack is super cute and lightweight but the zipper grips will all fall off within the first few days and the zipper ALWAYS gets stuck on the material. Every. Time. Annoying problem because my kid needs help every time he opened his backpack. Would recommend this for a kid 6 or younger.
Arrived late. I purchased for a trip I was going on, with plenty time for prime shipping, but it arrived late, and I was already gone. The product itself is good. Size (length) is a little long, but fits ok in a big purse. Comes with it's own strap, so you can use it on it's own, but the strap is very thin, and I wouldn't risk my passport, by using the thin strap as a carry strap. It has plenty of pockets for cards, passport, cash, etc. outside zips closed, but zipper can easily get caught on the carry strap if not careful. Zipper tabs are metal, so they won't break. Sewing looks good and well done. Outside is canvas type material, it's strong and should last. Nice color. Inside material is decent weight, not cheap looking, or easy to tear. If ordered, recommend allowing more than 2 days prime. Took my delivery 5 days. Overall I like the product and I would order again. (But with additional shipping time).
Something he wanted. Will hear from him when he gets the present.
Its soft the picture looks as thought its hard case, but its not. it does not hold its own. The opening was too small for me. The extra space underneath was not something I cared for.
The case is beautiful; however, when it arrived, the case lid for one of the days was already broken. Based on the reviews, I can see that simply exchanging this may not be a solution as many reviews state broken pill lids within a short time of using the product.
I really love it but one thing is one of the zipper handler is mess up. I am disappointed with that.
well built. Needs instructions on how to secure the pack as it falls off unless it is secured.
the bag came on time which is great. But there are no color options when ordering this bag, and the one I was sent is a completely different pattern, albeit striped, then the photo above
Worked for our wedding. More for decoration.
Good quality but opening is very small ...
Extremely cheap material the bag is already falling apart.
This bag is so cute! However the zipper hangs over the side as extra which makes it hard to zip over the shape of the bag. Also if there is to much in the bag, the zipper will break open - hard to fix. It's ok if you don't pack to much
Great bag for traveling or running errands. The stitching where the strap meets the bag did unravel after just 2 days, but that was an easy fix.
I bought it thinking about the brand. It came with some problems and poorly made parts. (The support that has the strap or is of very poor quality, or the screw is not what it should be).The lock system, for some reason, moved and I almost had to split it at an airport. Small wheels for some reason do not turn as they should. It is light and fulfills its mission, now for frequent travelers I don't know if I would recommend it.Obviously it was on offer, I don't know if the price is for the above or I just had bad luck.
it was o.k. nothing great
I really like this wallet and the only down fall is you can't put too much in it or the zipper will open. Very functional.
It's got a bad small to them don't what it is I'm trying to wash them but they look cheap don't know if it will hold up when I wash them but they small so bad.
I really want to love this bag. I usually buy Frye bags but this one had decent reviews and I liked the roll top which allows for varying degrees of content. Can be a backpack for my art supplies or an overnight bag, etc. I like the metal grommet reinforcement on the straps, etc. I like the color. Was very disappointed that the bag felt a little damp when I took it out of the plastic bag and now it has white micro dots all over the back side. Looks like mildew. They wipe off but reappeared. Bag doesn't smell mildewed but I don't know what else this could be. It also had a large scuff mark right out of the bag. Three stars was all I could muster up to give.
Nice bag, perfect size for what I wanted it for. Biggest issue is that the water bottle holders on either side are way too small, I'm cutting them off and plan on sewing bigger ones on.
ziper came with problem. The main zip did not work. It is blocked.
One worked great, was able to set the combination exactly as described. The other one never worked.
I ordered this carry-on to take on a recent trip. Unfortunately when I received it, it was a 25” piece of luggage and not the carry-on. I returned the originally shipped item and Amazon sent me a replacement. The replacement was also a 25” piece of luggage. I feel like the luggage was mislabeled in the warehouse for this to happen twice now. Amazon Customer Service was great to work with; they are investigating everything and are being very accommodating. I wanted to post this review to warn others to check the tag on the bag itself as others may think they have the carry-on size and may have received the 25” in error. My purchase was made on Prime Day.
I bought these to replace the Pottery Barn Kids that we have had for 3 years that is hold. It is larger than the Pottery barn and has more pockets. The side water bottle pocket is a must for our family. This rolls just fine. Minus two stars for the poor zipper action (it is not smooth like the Pottery Barn one). I liked them enough to keep them for the kids to use but if it was mine I would look for a higher quality made one
Nicely made, but inadequate room for normal wallet contents. OK for special purposes or occasions.
When going through customs you have to take your passport out. Its also bulky if your carrying several in your purse when traveling with children.
I like this bag however, it does not have a bottle holder
Looks great - ready to pack them!
Used this for a weekend trip and packed one blazer and dress shirt. I was pretty hyped about this bag because I did not like lugging around a traditional garment bag plus a second bag of other items for a 2-3 day trip. Much to my dismay when I unpacked my dress clothes, they were incredibly wrinkled. I think had I balled them up inside the bag they would have been better off than how they were after traveling. You can see the end result in the attached photos. I'm going to try some other packing methods since I love this concept, but disappointed at the current level of wrinkles.
I can get over the bad smell but it's also very poorly made the zippers are always getting stuck and the back zipper small pocket isn't even able to open. You must be very gently with it and even then it can get frustrating to handle sometimes. Still super cute and I'll use it while it lasts. Def not worth the $20 tho more like $10 or $5
Never received product. Amazon did a full refund. Probably not the companies fault but. Dry disappointing. I was looking forward to Using this bag.
I took it on a trip and already it shows some wear at the seams. Probably won't be a good long term bag
The backpack isn't very sturdy, thin material, cheaply made.
Too big, has to be checked, returned. Does have lots of pockets though
Was assuming I could fit more cards into it but overall I'm satisfied.
I bought this set for Christmas, and we've used it for two short trips. By the beginning of the second trip, the backpack stitching came undone. The larger bag has held up ok as a carry-on, but not the backpack. The return window has closed, which is a bummer. Wouldn't buy this again, I'd spend a bit more on a higher-quality product.
I should have paid attention to the size. This thing is cute but it is small. I am a big girl but I am will to try it out and see how it works out in public. If it's not to my liking after a few wears, then I will give it to my niece and buy a bigger one. I did get what I paid for, I just did not pay attention to the size, so that was on me.
Love the style, feel all of it. The only issue is I thought it would be a little bigger and I was hoping for more color but it really only pops with a flash on a camera..
Quality could be better for price
Ok bag had a stain on it when I opened it. Contacted the company and no apology just told me I could hand wash it.
Got this for our trip to Disneyland this June.
It's just ok. Looks nice but doesn't fit as much as my other travel document holder case. Doesn't hold much for my needs.
Looks good but build is very cheap not confident it will last more than a year
The idea and design is really good. Two things keep it from being 5 stars. First the compartment for the laptop is so deep that it ends up making the other half of the case to shallow. Instead of being about 2 inches deep it is 4 (or nearly half the case). Second, I used it on one trip and it is already starting to show scuff marks so I'm not sure how well it is going to last.
Beware! The measurements are not correct! This is over 8” in depth.
I really like the design of the backpack, but it is not practical for a college student. This is a good backpack to hold maybe 2 books. There's days where I walk almost 2 miles because of my classes and my back is hurting and aching. It's a very bulky backpack and doesn't fit much in it. I have to shove things back in if I take something out. I also cannot have my 15” laptop in it without taking something else out. It also smelled strong of plastic when I first got it. I'm going to be upgrading from this backpack.
Strap for mat poor location and bag not as big as expected, not worth the cost but is cute!
This isn't my first Travelon purchase and even though I am returning this bag, it is not because of the quality or features of the bag itself. I just need a larger travel bag, a "personal item" that I can store my ipad, headphones etc. and put under the seat of an airplane. This bag would be great for traveling with littles, you could keep a lot of items in this purse. Just note the opening is very narrow so larger items will take some wrangling to get into the body of the bag. In the end, for me, this was not large enough for all the stuff I need schlep around while traveling.
Seems very sturdy. Haven't yet used it. Unfortunately, it's very heavy.
Good Basic Scale. But not super accurate can be off a 1 or 2 lbs. Can make a difference if you are near the limit for your luggage
This bag is a little smaller than expected, but it still serves the purpose I intended it for. I like a small bag to carry my computer and planner for work separate from my school bag. I love the pink and grey pattern, its very spring themed, but still a subtle grey. The straps are adjustable and the section closes up so that your things dont fall out. I wish the label wasn't in the middle of the purse, I dont like that part. Other than the size of the bag and the label, I like the purse!
Blowing it wasn't too hard, though it sits a bit too low off the edge of the seat
Kind of difficult to use, not a fan!
Is big, but it feels so heavy. The bagpack alone is light, but It doesn't matter if you only have a couple of things (which you won't because it fits a lot) it gets really heavy. Definitely not a good bag for a day walking around. The customer service was great. Maybe I will have better luck with another product.
Not the best material, and not the sturdiest... but seems to be holding up pretty well. You'll get what you paid for and nothing more.
Nice bag, at least my son who I bought it for likes it. Only draw bag is that the string came apart the first time he used the bag.
Shoulder strap detached at the bag after a short period of use. Otherwise a great bag.
It was too much to my liking. I had to stuff it because the bottom corner had a dent in it. Have used it yet, and I'm truly hoping the stuffing works. Just didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back. I do kind of like it. The color is true.
Took like 3 months to be delivered
I only received a backpack and a water bottle. I need the other items ASAP. This pack is a gift!
The product is more not as it looks in the picture it's more faded. I was disappointed in how it looked
Thought this was going to be great for my airplane travels but it didn't meet expectations. It took a bit of effort to blow it up. Also the air cap would fall off when not in use (it has a ring that goes around) should be permanently affixed. Once it was all put together it was fairly comfortable.
It's serves its purpose but it is not PU leather and it's definitely not texturized as it looks in the picture. It's plastic.
The bag is nice looking and a lot of things could fit in it. This bag is good as a gym bag or as a travel bag. The issue, that this bag has is plastic hooks on the strap. There are two metal coils on the bag, however the hooks that are connected with coils are plastic, which means that they are not proof enough. Of course, the bag should not be overloaded, however when you are traveling, if the plastic hook breaks, you will not be happy. Also, in my case the strap that holds the bag is twisted and I think that this is a manufacturing bug. Please, see the pictures for better understanding what I am talking about. Overall, the bag is good and I would recommend it to the others. I would be very happy if sellers could send me the strap that is not twisted and if possible - with a metal hooks.
It works great as a backpack but the grey is not really grey it has a purple tinge to it. Also, the tightening of the straps is not the easy pull to tighten and lift to loosen. You have to take the time to push the straps through to loosen. Not that big of a deal but I have a tendency to do that a lot with different outings. But everything else is good.
Not a hard shell. Plastic gives easily. Expected something more sturdy. Doesn't hold as much as nylon or other soft sided luggage. Easy to spot in airport, looks good in orange but somewhat disappointing.
Screen is hard to read, half is blurred and need to turn to an angle to see the whole digit.
The bag wobbled when pulled by the handle and would tip over constantly. Ended up hating dragging it through the airport. Won't use it again. Now shopping for a sturdier bag.
i love the design but it stoped working right away
I hate to say it, but this backpack is not as roomie as I thought it would be. Yes, I know is a camera bag and yes, it holds my camera things and computer very nicely. However, the compartment just above the camera barely has enough room for a composition book. I had to downsize my notebooks so that I could carry more than one at a time. Not entirely thrilled with my back pack. Overall: GOOD for small things and holding your camera. BAD fo carrying schoolwork.
I have only used these one time and the zipper broke on one of them.
Great product for price however after 2 months the strap at the top ripped. If you have to carry a lot of books the lunch box doesn't fit in the front very well.
Love the bag but it's is missing charging port. Need for school so I will not return but disappointed that they send a slightly different bag.
The previous reviews regarding the wheels being too close together causing the bag to wobble when trying to walk with the bag is the only flaw
I bought it in December and it already broke... :(
after a few months the plastic begins to break apart from the stitching
We bought this two months ago for my teenager and it's already tearing on the inside. Disappointed because she loves the print and shoulder straps are comfortable.
Was able to be refunded after told seller never received...I brought another one from seller that I am satisfied with
Zipper handle broke off 2 days after I got it. Other than that it's a pretty decent backpack.
This attractive, sturdy looking wallet broke immediately while unzipping the small change pocket. Off came the entire zipper with no hope of putting it back on again. So frustrating as it was a gift.
For me it was too big but it useful grate fro traveling
Flimsy elastic but good size
Too small! Very narrow
I bought the bag hoping it would comfortably carry my 12” iPad Pro but the fit is too snug and it doesn't feel padded enough. For a regular size tablet it might fit well, although the padding is light. The outer two pockets are nicely setup to organize the contents with little pockets and loops. I do not like the big pouch on the strap. I'm not going to use it for anything so I just have this big empty rectangle in the middle of my chest when I wear the bag. Even though it doesn't comfortably fit my tablet I might have kept it but I dislike the big cellphone pouch too much and ended up returning it.
This bag is probably good for one season. Calling it 'canvas' might be somewhat of an overstatement. It is made of thin material. Not really big enough to carry a lot of beach gear. For the price, you do get a useable hat and little case.
Only disappointment is that it's not a clip on like expected.
Shoulder strap clip broke the first time it was used. Only small pockets in the bag so hard to keep things organized. Good size for carry on luggage other than that.
It is very well made which makes it heavy for it's size, so that adds to the already limited weight restrictions for a carry-on on flights. Because of this, I almost wish that I hadn't taken it on my International trip.
I love my bag but was not happy that it did not arrive with my 2 day shipping with prime!
The lock broke the first time we used it.
while the bag is light and attractive, my child had an issue with straps. it would become loose by the end of the day. very frustrating to do a daily adjustment. other than that, no complaints.
Super cute, but after 1 use the inside of the smaller bag is broken... like the seam want sewed well to begin with.
I had higher expectations for it. Was not really worth $40. It looks pretty but if you take a closer look. It feels really cheap. Just be aware. It's a good looking bag. But if you're looking for something high quality, look elsewhere.
The airlines damaged my luggage. This set arrived promptly. While slightly smaller than my prior set it definitely suits my needs
I love the color (brown), and perfect size for essential oil blends for room spray. However, just a few sprays and the pump is sticking. These are the second different company I've tried and the others got stuck as well. Can anyone out there make decent non sticking pump spray bottles?
Cheap material with strings hanging off of it everywhere. The zippers also are cheap and will not last. But it's white and says Bride so it does the job! It's good for one wear and that's likely it. Don't get too rowdy in this fanny pack!
Nice but the zipper buckles on both sides of the bag which makes it difficult to start the close. If they could improve the zipper function I would have given it 5 stars.
This bag would have gotten 4 stars but I believe I am going to have to replace the wheels.
I have order this purse in White twice and yet I keep receiving Silver. Its Cute in Silver but I Really need it in White.
Have only used on one trip but they didn't hold up great. Just got back so will see if I can straighten the flap out so it will lay flat. Nice looking product
I love the classy design. I bought it for nursing school but it is very small. Can barely fit a binder in it due to the height. The width isn't great either. I would send it back, but I'm just going to use it as a personal bag for clinicals.
Just as advertised..
This is great looking bag. Looks and feels well-made. My biggest disappointment w it is that the straps (for use as a backpack) are too short. The product description doesn't note length of strap but I can see that it's limited to the strap used as a handle. But still. I can't use it as a backpack and that's what I really needed.
It's pretty and delivered super quick (I don't have prime) but it's a lot smaller than I was lead to believe. Not sure it will work for my needs. The picture I attached is all I could fit in the lunch bag and it is an extremely snug fit. I still need to be able to pack another container. :/
Adorable for my little monster. Shoulder strap is tearing after 1 month and loose strings all over.
Good fabric weight. Locking mechanism is a little hard to manage.
Cute bag but I really got this in order to use this with the shoulder strap & it unfortunately did not come with one. Cute bag though
Top loop strap broke off pretty quickly but quality is as expected for the price.
I may have to send it back.
Comfy bag. Took it on a business trip to NYC. Holds a tablet well, but not really for a 14" laptop. Great for weekends and vacation, too.
II purchased this bag for the Khaki color and the color is great. This bag isn't for me because it does not carry well. Handle is too long to carry on arm and won't stay on the shoulder. The zipper to keep bag close doesn't go from end to end so things fall out.
I did get this on sale and the quality is cheap looking. It's not the best quality.
This was a lot smaller than expected.
Under light rain, it is pretty water resistant, but if it's down pouring and you have to run to your car then this backpack will not protect your items from getting soaked.
Love the look of the purse but is very small
Bag has no support to keep it from folding in on itself, other than that I really like it.
It was too small for what I needed it for
Love these only tho is the zipper feels a little weak and like it might break so I unzip it gently other then that I love it it's beautiful and their perfect sizes and come in so handy
The tags are great. Some of the ties got pretty thin.
The pic looks like it's bigger then what it really is and it's small as ever but most off all it's a nice bag
The size of bag is a good size, the strap around the neck area needs to be more cushioned and contoured for better placement.
Looks nice and I like that there is extra pockets for everything. We'll see how it holds up.
Only took it on a trip once and it was a road trip. Love how it folds back into a compact pouch. Havent tested the durability yet (material, handles on bag, strap on bag), ie airplane flight, walking through the terminal, etc. The handles and strap on it seem pretty sturdy but like I said, havent really gotten a chance to truly test it out.
Cute little wallet. I'm not sure how well the RFID works, but it has lots of pockets perfect for travel. Super disappointed in the color. Ordered the Aqua and it's faded and not at all like the color in the photo. I would return or exchange, but it's not really free returns. Free if you live next to an Amazon drop-off, which I don't. I'll use it but I wouldn't recommend it if you're particular about colors.
The quality is awesome but the smell from the leather is awful. The zipper they used is too small and I don't have the room to put inside the items I use daily. Runs small for me. So I will return it.
The size is great for carrying in a small purse and the card slots seem quite secure. Only issue is I have to insert my passport half in the area for it - so only the back half is secured in the holder and then the rest folds with the wallet. I don't have the thicker passport so this was a surprise. It is still ok, but not what I was expecting. Leather feels really thin and cheap. If someone handed this to me, I wouldn't believe it was leather.
Purchase this for my teenager daughter , she loved the design and size but I was a bit disappointed about the price - quality ratio . I don't feel the lunch pack nor the backpack are made of the best fabrics , she has almost 2 weeks of wearing and holding fine . Overall 3.5 out of 5 stars on my book cuz for the same price I could get any of the nicer brands.
My 5 yr old nephew loves locks for whatever reason so I got these for his stocking. I locked them all together and gave his the keys on a ring. He loved that they where color coordinated and easy for him to figure out. However to use these as regular locks isn't a great idea. Some of the keys still work for the other locks, yet some don't. Also, the keys for the lock they are designed for is sometimes very hard to actually get into the lock. It gets stuck and you have to move it around to get it to unlock. I gave 3 stars because it's good for kids but as an adult, not great.
I really like it but it's small my laptop barely fit. And I barely fit my headphones case and other small stuff.
i repurposed to soften hands free leash. works well tho
Too big, gets trapped in wheels
Too small with if it's possible too many pockets. I spend a lot and I mean a lot of time fumbling through them to find a pen or lipstick.
Bought these suitcases to take on a trip out of the country and to transport some fragile items. Overall, I am glad I bought these, they served their purpose. However, after the first flight, there was visible punctures through the hard sided surfaces, multiple deep scratches, and creases visible where the hard side had actually bent. This was a little disappointing when it came to durability after one flight. BUT for the price, it got our items safely to their destination and I would probably buy again.
ridged and heavy, looks good but did not like traveling with it.
My daughter picked this out and I worried about the size of it not being large enough... Unfortunately, I was right. She will need to carry a few things in her hand. We both really like the zipper and the way it opens the backup up like a suitcase almost. You can lay it down on your desk and open the zipper and access everything easily. This size is just too small.
Very cute bag! Decent sizing and loved the fact that it came with a pouch inside. The only downside is that the zipper is CHEAPLY made.... It broke within a week of getting the bag.
Nice enough, a little smaller than I expected. Inline wheels only
They worked well for our trip and seemed to save space. Held up well.
They are nice bags for the price. We used them for my daughter's birthday party as goodie bags and personalized them for each girl. While we were ironing on some of the letters the bag seemed to get to hot and now have little ripples in them not bad enough that they can't be used but that's why I gave them 4 stars since they said they could be used with iron-on transfers also the strings seem cheap but it goes with the price paid. They did turn out cute and I think the girls will love them!
It was missing the shoulder strap.
They are ok, not the best.
First time purchasing hardside luggage. Plan to purchase additional suitcases for the family. Very easy to overfill; therefore must be careful in not overloading when packing.
It's well made and I enjoy it, but really wish the card slot for a picture ID opened to the top and not to the middle. For as often as a person may have to get your license out, its a freakin' hassle! Otherwise, good product.
It looks great! The most outstanding feature is the choice of color which makes my bag stand apart from other garnet bags. This is a good addition to my quick travels when I need a few changes and allows me to carry my longer dresses without having to bunch them at the bottom of the garment bag.
Really sturdy well constructed suitcase. What I liked least about the suitcase is that it was not the one shown in the photo, the black with the orange trim and wanted it to match the same orange and black suitcase but in the larger 25" version I had purchased at the same time.
I have been using the hard side holder for a few months but it became too cumbersome for the number of cards I have to carry. This one is easier and has more room for cash. And I haven't spilled cards all over the store floor since I got it.
This bag works great for me! I've been looking for awhile for this style of bag! I can put my sweaty gym clothes in the bag close it and done! I can put back in my gym bag without having to worry about my clothes stinking up my bag! It seals the wetness and odors! This bags holds socks,underwear,shorts, and shirt with no problem! That's plenty for me you may need a bigger size if you want to pack your shoes and workout pants or sweatshirts! Its real easy to clean as well!
Loved it . Very light weight and enough room to hold spare items in the main part plus a water bottle. Only downside is it could use two zippers on small outside pocket. Closing one zipper all the way round was inconvenient to stop small things from falling out
This laptop backpack is durable, fashionable, and perfect for travel. The only downside is that the handle cannot be slipped over the shoulder and carried like a tote.
Easy to spot. No problems with it so far! Only wish it had 360 wheels for functionality.
Don't like that it has a place for coins
Only 4 starts becsuse I haven't use them yet...waiting for my cruise trip in summer. So far I'm happy with the product look like a great value and quality.
I got this backpack for my 8 year old daughter. If you want it for traveling it's perfect (good material, several divisions and pockets). I got it for Elementary school and it is too big for my daughter to handle, specially when getting in or out of the car.
Love it even more on person. Unique and super cute Material
It holds a ton of clothes, it's definitely made cheaply but that's what I expected for the price anyway. I think the zipper could bust if you have the bag stuffed, but it should be fine if you leave room in it.
This credit card holder works fine. I only wish it could hold more. It came just in time, it came just before I left for my vacation. I like it, it works fine.
Really cute, but it stinks a bit. I will have to try to wash it and I hope that turns out well. It looked way smaller than I expected when I got it, but like the TARDIS it seems bigger on the inside and holds a decent amount of stuff. Construction is sturdy also. Overall a really good buy for the price minus the mildew smell.
Nice bag daughter loves it. Could you a pouch for her water bottle. The side zip Pockets are too small for her current water bottle.
They were perfect and stayed intact during the mad Christmas/New Years travel.
We love the packing cubes. Ordered as gifts too.
My son picked this backpack out. We just received it in the mail & it's green instead of blue. He is a little disappointed, but opted to keep it anyway. Other than that , it seems to be a well made bag.
It's truly beat as a great 2nd bag to take for “just in case” you overload on shopping, but not good for the extended trip...the bag is sturdy, but not the easiest to manage when you're trying to travel quickly between trains or in/out of a car.
Have not used it yet.
Nice...hope it withstands 14 hours of travel
This seems like a good backpack . I will not know till I go to the gym and see how it holds up . Keep you up to date .
Great wallet, arrived very fast and exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a wallet that holds 8 cards and does not have a picture flap. I found this and it fit the bill perfectly (pun intended). The leather is nice and soft, looks durable and the stitching is nice and straight. The pockets are a bit tight with even 1 card in each, but I assume that will loosen up over time. The width is just a touch larger than I would like (but still reasonable), it fits in a back pocket fine but just a touch smaller would be great. Overall very happy with it.
Wasn't quite as big as I thought it would be. However, I take quite a few overnight trips and it's held up well. Overall I'm not disappointed
Only giving 4 stars because I thought it was a little bigger. I put two small (10 1/2 oz )soup cans on top if each other so you can get an idea of the height. Very stylish and not bad for the price. The hardware isn't that durable but over all cute purse.
Love this wallet. The color is very pretty and I love the layout of the card holders inside and the fact that it holds a lot of them. I'm not a fan of the covering on the I.D slot, but other than that it's really nice.
I always fall forward when trying to sleep on an airplane. This product is effective of preventing me falling. Still not necessary the most comfortable position to fall asleep, but in combination with a neck brace, works fairly well.
This is a product that I have bought before and I just bought another set due to the fact that I lost my older ones. Out of all the TSA approved ones I have tried, I have like these the best even though they are sometimes a pain to use.
Bought this as my personal item for flight to Alaska. Have a ton of things in there including purse, jacket, snacks, extra set of clothes, few toiletries, iPad, etc. Plenty of room.
so cute. My one-year-old wears this around the house even on the weekends, only gave it a 4 star because it's a little small (can't fit much) - but she can wear it and likes to, which is good!
Great for what I needed it for, lasted me a long time! Only thing is I had to safety pin it to fit me because I guess I'm too skinny, I'm 5'7" and 120lbs 🤷
Nice product. Heavier than I thought they would be and wish the colored bands fit better. Overall, will work fine for my use.
Love the way the interior of the backpack is designed. Only problem is the exterior side pocket - too small for insulated water bottle. A net/elastic material with some give would be much better!
This is definitely very durable, because the material of the bag is so strong, however, it's not too big, you can fit a couple of clothes toiletries and some accessories, but good one for shorter trips. There is fixed padding on the bottom, so it's not that firm, but if you place the clothes accordingly, it might stay strong.
Did not come with any instructions, but overall easy to assemble. Worked well
I love this laundry bag, it's compact for travel and folds neatly in a pouch sewn into the bag. The drawstrings, zipper, and material are all suited for the wear and tear of travel.
Great wallet. Have been using it for almost 3 years now and there is only a little tearing on one of the liners.
It's nice, but very, very small. Not anywhere close to the color or size pictured.
Well made, very durable, just a little too heavy
I loved it. The color is great and all the safer features make me feel secure when traveling. I just wish it was convertible from a backpack to a crossbody bag
Light weight, good wheels many colors tsa locks
I really like the wallet, it's a little hard to get cards in and out, the multi tool is sharp enough to shave with. So tuck a few bandaids in it, your going to need them. Needs better instructions included.
Put phone in it , on the waist so u can hear the phone easily take out n put back easily n not heavy on the shoulder more convenient compare to carring purse
I purchased this item. I really doubt that it is RFID blocking though, since it looks like most other pouch type holders. But just to be safe on that, I went ahead and purchased the RFID blocking sleeves to put our passports into. This item holds a good deal, although its not super big. Rather thinly made too.
This little carryon is fantastic, I ordered the champagne color & it's a great neutral. There are four wheels on the bottom that spin 360 degrees which is great for maneuverability. When you open it, the storage space is half on one side of the shell & half on the other, with a zippered flap to keep each side separated. I packed a week's worth of stuff in mine for a road trip (clothes, toiletries, makeup, blowdryer, flat iron, curling iron, and sandals), and it fit everything & still wasn't too heavy. I haven't flown with it yet, but will be using it as a carryon for a plane trip in a few months and will update my review then. So far, it is an awesome piece of luggage for a low price, and the only con I can think of is when the telescoping handle is at its most extended height it feels a bit wobbly, but not like it's going to snap or anything, just a tad wiggly. I'm 5'4, so I only extend it halfway anyway, and it feels strong. Overall, I would definitely recommend!
Love it!! Just wish it was a little bit bigger for more cash/coin space. That pocket is just to small. Can barely get my hand in to remove my money!
Cute looks exactly like the pic, need a wallet in the same color
The product is good, but the package is like Mmmm just a plastic bag and idk maybe They can use a Box for the look quality.
These were pretty sturdy! They didn't come off of my luggage at all.
it was what I NEEDED
Great bag with tons of space!
Cute bag! Roomy for what I keep in it. I'm a nurse and just wanted a bag to throw miscellaneous items in that don't need to go in my purse such as umbrella, medications, charging cord, water bottle, extra pens, etc...
I am changing my rating due to several reasons. First off the customer service I received from this seller was PHENOMENAL. I am very pleased with the new packing cubes and love the convience of them so much. Very pleased with these packing cubes.
Really nothing I don't like about it. I got one for our family (can easily hold four racquets and 6 balls) and for my parents. They are glad to have theirs as well.
It's cute and small. Don't pull this thing out in a bad storm. It's good for a rainy day or some drizzle but the second the wind picks up this baby is breaking like a toothpick.
Wish it was just a bit wider, some of the cards wouldn't fit in some of the spots, so had to rearrange a few times, but all fit.
Lots of storage, durability, I just had one problem, the front small pocket zipper always gets stuck so I do not even bother to use it.
This has been a versatile backpack to has proven to be useful for many trips. It works great!
Multi tool not that functional and hinders use of wallet. Durability I great! Look is great.
Cute Cover Case and holds the Passport as it should. I wish I didnt have to pull the passport of out of the case but it does its job.
It's made well, comes with plenty of spacers and extension you can put a wide amount of key configurations. It shipped fast
I have had the backpack for 3 months now. Works great for my everyday commute. I do wish it was wider so I can fit my little insulated lunch bag. Also the bag is beginning to rip a little from one of the handles. But works great for the price!
Purchased a 24 & 28" a few days ago at a certain price. Returned the 24" because it was smaller than another 24" we had. I then ordered another 28" a few days later. And the price has increased by $14. Yet the company will not honor the lesser price. I don't understand this policy. Not good customer service.
It's a bit heavy to carry as a purse. But it's exactly what I was looking for when traveling. Has pockets on both sides that fits water bottle.
This is an adorable backpack and my three-year-old loves it. It is the perfect size to fit a change of clothes, snack, water bottle, and one of her small blankets. She wanted to bring it to preschool, but it does not fit a full-sized folder, so she can't. My intention is to use it on trips in the car and to the daycare area at the YMCA. I don't really care for the flap on the front that you left up to see what's in the small front pocket, but my daughter loves looking at what's inside. I would purchase again for my other children.
Great for the cost. Very affordable!
Cute golden wallet for my niece. Bought it for her birthday present. It has cute little charm. Holds cash & coins well. She really loved it. Made me very happy!
The colors on the backpack are a not so great. It's ok I guess
Comfortable & able to hold my items
Had it for over three years now-used it everyday. Nice strong material. One Zipper is broken near an edge but bag still usable. I think its a great value-cant expect a lifetime of use from such a bag
no latch on top. handle does not compress
This is the second one of these bags our family owns. I would happily buy another and have recommended them to family. I have done 16 days of international travel out of this bag and it has fit in every overhead bin I have tried it in. My only want would be for a bit more support in the back/straps. I would not want to carry this bag for more than an hour the way it is designed. I think a nice backpacker support system would be worth the increase of weight.
Bought this backpack to use a personal item on Spirit Airlines. Mission accomplished. It's pretty well organized with a okay quality for the price.
Love these bags. Got one for the gym and other for the pool. The only bad thing is they are very thin.
I really haven't used it yet but it seems alright.
This is a good product. Lots of pockets for organisation and fits underneath seat when traveling.
Like it but it's a little on the big side. Still functional and easy to use. Cards don't slide in and out that easily but with more use it should. Overall still a nice wallet.
This was a great carry on luggage; however, after only one use the straps tore off. Luckily, someone in my family knows how to sew and was able to repair it. Other than that issue, it was pretty sturdy. It was the perfect size for a carry on and fits a good deal of clothes. The manufacturer just needs to work on reinforcing the seams so the straps don't tear off. I haven't used it more than once so I cannot elaborate on the other seams.
great wallet but the money clip keeps falling out
Great. Love it's size and how compact it is. Unfortunately, I struggle with getting the cards located in the middle of the wallet out. But it's still a great wallet.
The color and feel are great. The product is a great price and will probably be fine if you don't travel much like me. But a few of the parts feel a little janky, especially the main handle. Probably not for heavy use.
Not a bad bag, just not what I wanted. The construction seemed nice enough. But it is too small to carry as a purse. Return was easy, but I had to pay the postage.
Looks good. Like its features. Only time (and travels) will tell if it's durable
My son absolutely loves this! Its a little small for school, however. Its hard to get folders in, it wont zip up.
The bag works super well. Used it for the beach was able to keep my drinks cool and still able to have a spare change of clothes in the bag. Definitely worth the purchase.
Perfect for my 2 year old grandson to carry, but a little small to keep his toys, diapers, wipes, etc.
Not quite as sturdy as I hoped, but other features are nice
The faux leather is amazing and sturdy. I love the over all design except the glitter (makes it hard to see pins in sunlight) on the window. Everything looks really good my only problem I could see is the fabric between the window and the bag seems alittle thin, but everything else is perfect!
Belt worked perfectly for carrying money and cards. The quality of the product was good as well. I did find that placing a cell phone in there made it too bulky under my clothes
My little one is at the stage where a huge diaper bag is no longer a necessity but I do need a 2-3 diapers, wipes, toddler snacks, and a sippy cup. I wanted something smaller than his old full sized diaper bag that would hold both his things and mine while still looking stylish. This fits everything and is cute too. The two drawbacks are the color which looks more like a light green than a dark cyan to me (the straps are definitely just a straight dark green), and I really don't like the flap over the zippered front pocket which is very stiff and makes it hard to throw keys or a cell phone in it without a struggle (maybe it'll get better once it's worn in). These minor issues are definitely outweighed by the positives though.
I've been wanting a backpack purse and wanting one that will organize everything and be resistant to the elements. While being durable, this lacks any real organization. Wound up returning for that reason. Check out the Doughnut ones for interior pockets. There's also several 'off brand' versions that have the organization as well.
Great bag, very colorful. 4 stars because the hanging hoop came apart pretty quick.
Can someone contact me please ., I purchased extended warranty And the zipper is broken in and there's no contact seller at all on the website I paid for an extra warranty and expect to be reimbursed or send a new product please and thank you very much
The color is different from what I saw on Amazon before I bought it
Small convenient card wallet. Perfect for small purse. If you don't like to carry a handbag like me, then this is for you. I recommend it.
The size of the garment bag doesn't fit a normal sized men's suit. The length is too short so the bottom of a jacket is wrinkled and the clips are useless as the jacket goes past them. The width is too small for a normal suit hanger and the loop for the hanger is on the same side as the opening so you don't use the full size of the garment bag. Cool design with the zippers and transforming into a duffel bag too bad they made it too small. Edit: upped the rating up to 4 stars for excellent customer service, I would recommend this bag for people who are shorter than a 6'5" man.
This backpack is so dang cute!! It's bigger than I thought it would be which is GREAT for me. Definitely waterproof material, although I wouldn't trust electronics around the zipper in the main compartment in a true downpour. For the PNW misty rain, it works! Some loose threads here and there is fine, but I took one star away for durability because the handle on the top is already starting to come apart after only a few weeks of use. Maybe it's meant for tiny child journals and that sort of stuff, I mostly use it for holding travel things and groceries on transit. The water bottle holders are absolutely massive though! It means I can take my big chunky water bottle no problem.
Nice quality, very large pockets. I would recommend this bag!
Big and colorful so they're very noticable but very small card to write personal info on. Still happy with purchase.
It's cute, but you cannot personalize this one. It was smaller than I expected and not high quality, but it will serve the purpose and the price was right.
Bought them for a bachelorette party in Mexico and they were a hit! Mine had/has a faulty zipper however so if you unzip it all the way there's a good chance you'll lose the zipper. I ordered 5 however and the rest seemed to be fine
Beautiful and Got a lot of compliments, the only bad part is the size the boarding pass doesn't fits in. overall a great purchase.
Like it's quality, durable. It's a little thin. However, it was for our 14 year old daughter headed to a teen Conference. Worked perfectly!
Great deal for the price. I only used it for a trip where I drove so not sure how it would hold up if used for air travel.
If I had one complaint, it would be the overall rigidity of the handle at full extension. It's a bit flimsy. It's been on 3 business trips with me so far. The case itself is absolutely awesome! TONS of room inside. Had a ton of pockets /storage. Very sharp look. Wheels roll great!
Great-looking. Relatively easy to get cards back in, not so easy to get a single card out. Worth the price - especially when compared to other similarly designed minimalist wallets.
Works great. Cases is completely fabric and doesn't hold a solid form but my daughter loved it.
I really dig this bag! It's stylish and well made, great neutral color and is very functional w/ the shoe compartment and little outside pocket. I just wish it had an inside pocket for general stowage/wet garment separation for a swimsuit, wet socks, etc. But overall, I'm very happy with this bag. I'm a mobile DJ/Karaoke/Photo booth business owner and I used it mostly for my event wardrobe pretty much every weekend as well as personal trips and it's a tough bag. I paid $25 - Can't beat it for the price!
I bought this for my husband who's 6'1 and he did not use the hip strap because it was too high up for him but the backpack still worked great for a 2 week trip. I wore it sometimes too when we switched backpacks since mine was heavier (of course). I wish the thin hip straps were wider and better like a true travel backpack. They hardly offered support.
Portable, can be adjusted to use behind your back. Not as comfortable around the neck.
I love the carry on bag, however the big one dont look like it can take much. I had a few clothes in it and lift it to see and it looks like its pulling at the top by the zipper
I loved it so much I got one for each of my daughters, including one who will be traveling abroad in college
This is a good piece of luggage for air travel. It held up well and due to the design, it was our only suitcase to not lose its lock. We did use a luggage strap for added security (my kids had it packed totally full) and easier identification. Only 4 stars because I do question its durability over the long haul.
The price is right. The wheels are key for helping kids push it upright through the airport. My 7 year olds used it easily. The inside has room and one side has a zippered closure that covers the whole side. The telescoping handle seems a bit flimsy but for the price I'm not overly concerned.
It's actually pretty dirty. There seems to be some sort of residue on the inside and outside of the product, which makes it totes NOT clear. I wiped the inside with a damp paper towel and it kind of cleared it up. I haven't even tested it in the wind and rain, but I'm hoping it'll be better. Also, the handle was way longer than I expected it to be. I expected the dome to be a little bit smaller, but I didn't actually measure it out so that's on me. Anyway, the product is dirty af. Don't know if anybody else had any issues. I wouldn't buy this, nor recommend. Edit: I am bumping my rating up two whole stars because once it starts raining, you can't see the residue that was on it so problem solved. It also held up to some decent wind because it can't flip inside out. The handle is a bit on the heavier side.. or maybe I just need to hit the gym more lol.
Cute, cheap, packs away very small. Great for vacation and then to the beach.
This is a nice looking backpack and it is super spacious. It's almost too big for my daily life but its great for traveling when you need to fit a lot in a backpack. The only annoying thing is the side buckles undo pretty frequently if you bump it against a wall or something. Overall this is a great pack!
Bought this for my husband. He hates having bulk in his back pockets, so won't use a wallet. He tears everything up due to heavy use. Thus far, this has held up great. His only complaint is that it's uncomfortable in his front pockets.
I saw these on wish and really liked them so I found them on here for a similiar price with faster shipping. The only downside is I couldn't order individual colors and had to order as a set of 4 when I really wanted just 2 of 1 color. It did work out though as I ended up falling more in love with some colors unexpectedly. While I am super happy with mine, product quality is inconsistent so I ordered 2 sets and settled on keeping 1 and returning the other. Some of the zippers were sewn in lopsided or fabric had wierd scrunching. pros- Smaller than expected and fits my needs better Cool little details like the lettered fabric piece, small front pocket, liner, and different fabrics Cute patterns Comes with decent keychain, but is removable from loop to make it more versatile Looks like a real backpack Decent zipper Holds a decent amount of small items for safe keeping cons- Wish I could pick styles and buy individual ones since I don't need all 4 (a pro though would be that I can give them away as a cute add on gift). Front pocket doesnt have much use and is more decorative, but is sewn so it can still be opened which is confusing. Back is not patterned and plain fabric (a pro is it still matches though) Inconsistent quality
This is a very nice quality bag. It was exactly what I needed but a little too small for all the stuff my 6th grader needs for school. This is especially good for students in elementary school.
Basic travel bag. Purchased for a trip to the hospital. Held all my items then some room for more. Even though I did not go on vacation I will take this bag along everywhere I vacation with.
You can't beat the price point! I got these for a cruise around Italy. They're light and roll well and simply a large plastic shell with a handle, zipper and wheels. After reading other comments I will most likely wrap a bungee cord or two around the larger one that gets checked in. For two reasons; 1) since there is only a zipper and not an additional latch the way things are handled these days it may get busted open. 2) I can more easily identify it on the baggage claim conveyer when I go to pick it up....
The backpack is really cute and it fits fine. It would be helpful if the backpack had another strap to tie around the waist so it won't slide up as the kid runs and i pull the strap. The product arrived very fast. I am satisfied with my purchase.
It came at a decent time. Looks just like the picture. My daughter loves it.
I love the product material is strong and durable. It has plenty of pockets and especially the conformity of the bag, however. It doesn't stay upright when it has stuff in it. It always falls forward. The bottle holders are too short & narrow for a 34 oz. bottle. If it was 1.5 in. higher and slightly wider it would be just right.
This arrived and after checking it over I really liked it. For the price it does the job!
Good for traveling, vacations, outback, outdoors. It doesn't have a earphone socket you gotta cut it out yourself.
Very handy for my most recent trip - but wish there were a few more packets of detergent.
This bag is real quality. The leather is beautiful, and the interior well-sewn of good material. I just wish it were a little bigger!
Fun bag, it was perfect for my dress to travel.
Came quick and was easy
The colors were true to pictures, (I bought the white/blue/pink one) however it was cut really high on the hip and showed too much butt for me. Let's put it this way, if I wasn't moving around sure it'd be great but if you're moving etc It wouldn't have been comfortable. The fit up top was very comfortable however, sleeves and all. I also don't like that returns aren't 100% refunded due to having to pay for shipping, had I realized that before purchasing I probably would have moved on to a different suit. It's hard to buy online and something be perfect right off the bat.
It gets the job done
The zipper is hard to close with one hand and it is too long for my arm.
This weekender bag does the job! It holds everything you need (within reason). My only compliant is the smell when I first opened it. I had to drench it in perfume so it didn't smell as terrible as it did. I would recommend for those needing a weekender bag!
The bag seems like a good sturdy material. I love the print. Would work well for a crossbody or just over the shoulder. It's a decent size, not super small but not big enough to carry books for school or to double as a diaper bag. But it's a decent size purse.
This is the perfect size for my Sony a6000 camera with 210 zoom lens attached! I keep it in a form fitting neoprene sleeve, and can carry one bag instead of a camera bag plus a purse. My only complaint is that I don't like the way the silver clip on the strap stands out.
I love the fabric and appearance. the size and ease of handling.
I like the way the bag looks. It seems like it has a lot of room in it, too. I plan to carry it with me when I go to Peru. I like that it has the zipper and flap, as I think that's more secure. The quality is excellent. The straps are easy to adjust once you figure them out- but the bag seems like it could get heavy easily and annoying to carry after you fill it with everything you need so probably use it for light things like snacks, a camera, poncho, etc. But I'll wait and see for sure- it's been awhile since I've had to regularly carry a school bag! I think the shoulder straps could use better padding. Side pockets are great and the snaps are really secure. Also, it should work really well as a carry on. I recommend the bag.
Fits more than I expected given the size of the opening. Seems to be good quality and comfortable to wear.
Absolutely adore this product. Looks super cute and can carry a significant amount of weight.I usually use it just to go around therefore quite empty, not too heavy, but i have used it to brings books back from the library and it held up very well, i was impressed it could hold all that weight.
I grabbed this bag for a wedding that I attended in Spain. I was able to fit a 3 piece suite, 5 dress shirts as well as my wife's Maid of Honor dress in the garment portion of the bag. Once zipped up I fit 3 pairs of pants, 4 pairs of shorts, 5 tank tops and 4 other t-shirts (granted, I did use those vacuum seal bags to save room) The shoe compartment held a pair of dress shoes, converse, and 2 pairs of flip flops! All of that and I was able to fit the bag in the overhead carry-on bin with out any effort. On a negative note: The zippers for the duffel portion of the bag have a spring-loaded clasp that hold the zippers together - the spring on one of the clasps did not function and the clasp would open periodically. Also, the side pockets on the exterior have magnetic snaps and one of them popped off. I have yet to reach out to costumer service for a replacement, I'm wondering how they back their product and will update when I hear from them.
Cute bag! I used it to travel. Only negative is the magnetic closure should be stronger and easier to snap
Does fit my iphone 7 plus with cards. But its a tight fit. Overall a good purchase. Very good tailoring
This is pretty good and easy to maneuver. Don't underestimate the spinner design! My only complaint is that there is no way for it to stay open while you're packing or unpacking.
It's slim with nice leather finish, but bills folded make it difficult to remove them.
I ordered this set 1 because i absolute dislike cold weather and I love being warm. I loved every item in this set except the earmuffs they are very thin but once you combine it with the hat and the neck warmer it does what it needs to. It was in the 30's in my area last week and this set definitely came in handy. I would recommend it.
Never got the umbrella. Please refund my money Got emails saying it was lost
What I love: it's as big as advertised, it fits everything I need to teach 4 classes and keeps my laptop safe (it has a padded bottom and a separate pocket for laptops). What I didn't like: the fabric is crinkly and the zippers are hard to open or close, no matter how careful you are (other reviews mention that they tend to break). My old High Sierra backpack had a small pocket on the strap to keep old phones or small objects at hand, this one doesn't.
Bigger than I expected
Great suitcase, but it's quite heavy to be honest.
slightly more rectangular than square
does what it is supposed to do.
Great product. Useful during travel. Not sure it will hold up for everyday use as it has a small tear near the top loop already. I really like it and it looks great.
Pictures more appealing than the actual product. It serves our purpose. To that extent we are happy.
I used this with my band equipment as a dedicated bag to hold cables relating to my stage lights. Worked great for it. I also got a black one for power cables / extension cords, also doing an excellent job for that.
So far my kids like it. They use for school. But I don't know why my daughter strap got broken otherwise good product. Worth it for its price.
Adorable. Small for the little ones. Works well.
I've only used these once and loved them! They making packing so much easier and take care of my overpacking tendencies. The string on every zipper broke though during the first use! I was able to easily tie them back on . . . but still disappointing.
I love this bag, just wish the strap wasnt always twisted. I think it was sewn backwards
I bought it for my niece for a trip to Hawaii. She loved it and it fit everything she needed.
Very slim. Slightly tight when inserting bills.
I like that it feels sleek and durable. I just received it in today. The only issue I have is that some of my cards are a little large for it, as I planned to use it for medical cards.
Bought this for a trip to jazz fest in New Orleans. The straps are a little bulky and wider than I would like but otherwise it's a good fanny pack. Not the strongest material being used for the inside liner but it gets the job done. I wore it all day walking around and had no issues.
It does pick up war wounds, mostly scuff marks. On the plus side. it is easy to spot on the baggage merry-go-round.
My little grandaughter loved her luggage. She was packing everything she had.
Used the suit case once and the zipper broke completely while aboard. Awful and such a waste of money! Had to scramble to buy a new suitcase to bring everything home in! When I contacted the company, they did fix the problem by sending a new suit case to me. They have been very responsive and wanted to make the situation right.
This bag rolls very easily and is a good size to carry on an airplane. I was disappointed in the fact that it expands only a little bit on the bottom end. I know this is so it is still weighted right to keep it from tipping over, but I wish I had bought a bag that expanded more to hold purchases along the way. (I usually check my bag on the return because I expand it.) It seems very sturdy and well-made.
It had scratches on it. Color lighter than expected but my dad loves it so win win.
I love the vibrant colors. Glad I can put it in the wash to clean it. It protects my hard luggage from being beat up.
Very cute! My daughter is 7 and loves it. We haven't seen anyone at her school with it.
Seems sturdy, opens easily, retracts well. A little longer than I thought it would be when closed, and the nice cover that comes with it is a little too snug to get on easily, so I'll probably just have to leave it off. Yes overall, a very good purchase - will do the job. Best feature is its extremely quick, reliable, one-click opening.
Product got here faster than expected which is a plus!!!
Looks great and feels great. But it tore at the top from light use of just a laptop and 2 notebooks. Fortunately, customer service is great and kindly replaced it, more than happy to continue using their products
This is a very slim wallet that fits everything I've stuffed into it. I probably have it a bit overloaded from the membership and ID cards I carry. This does not mean the wallet is too small, it means I carry too much and need to pare down. When I say somewhat small I mean that it could be maybe a quarter inch taller to keep bills and checks from getting bent and folded at the edge. I had a check I needed to deposit so I put it in my wallet. The top was bent and wrinkled from be able to be bent at the top. Besides this, it's a great wallet. I'll see how it holds up over the next few months.
Looks so nice. perfect for less cards
Good quality of kids bag
This is great! It is very spacious so there is plenty of room for all of my stuff if I need it. I usually don't pack it to the brim so sometimes I wouldn't mind it being a little smaller but I like that it works for those other times. The bottle seems to stay in place pretty well and the zippers work well too.
Liked the product but do not measure diagonally like it says or it will be too big. Measure straight up and down.
The watermelon red color in the photo is much brighter in person and more of a coral color. Also ended up being too small for my needs: I forgot to check the dimensions (my fault). It's only a little bigger than a coin purse.
I loved the color, quality, variety of card slots, etc. only suggestion is to include wrist strap.
exactly what I was looking for
Nice quality. Smaller than expected.
I purchased this item and traveled last week for my work and loved it. I had just one problem in regards to the operation of the retractable handle. I had no problem with the handle fully extending and then collapsing into the bag. It does not seem to lock into place for any of the heights between completely collapsed and full extension. Is this a problem that anyone else has reported having? I love the bag but find this is a little annoying when I do not want the handle to fully extend.
Bought for my husband the quality is very nice. He likes it very much.
The size is just right, but I asked for Navy and received more of a teal color. I can live with that. My suggestion to the maker of this product is not to have a black interior. I can't see the internal pockets and have to find them by touch.
Good for traveling on airplanes
This bag was so cute and I absolutely loved it and hope the child I purchased it for enjoys it with her supplies also. The only reason for 4 stars is because it was smaller than I realized so I got a supplemental backpack. So cute though!
Love this backpack, but I just don't like that some water bottles don't fit on the sides.
Slightly smaller than I expected but the material of the body of the bag was exactly what I wanted. Feels durable. It holds a 5x7 note book, 3x5 note book, my wallet, phone, keys, a couple envelopes of mail, and a bunch of small accessories in the zip pockets. My one concern is the strap. It feels very light and flexible which have always been signs of poor quality to me in the past. It will probably be the first thing to break, and the last thing anyone carrying it would want to break. All zippers work smoothly. No idea what the script on the emblem means.
I needed a couple of carry-on bags F-A-S-T and as usual, Amazon delivered (pun intended). These are the perfect size for the overhead bins and big enough to pack a week's worth of clothes(to a warm locale, with packing cubes) and 3 pairs of shoes. I was pleased with the overall look of this luggage, however I am already noticing some loose threads. Hopefully, I'll be able to get more use out of these before they completely unravel.
Love it.Very accessible.Easy to Cary.
I like the bag and the size of it. It tends to tip over when unbalanced, but you can just put a few books or supplies in it to help that issue. I haven't had this long enough to rate durability.
Just got back from a week in Paris, France. I only saw ONE man with a wallet in his backpack. I was glad I had this. I used it for holding cash, cards, tickets, and a pen under my jacket. It is comfortable, thin, and almost unnoticeable under a fleece jacket. The bag itself is well made, with nice solid buckles. It will be my go to International wallet.
Survived most of the school year with my 8 year old. So far, I've had to re-sew the strap back to the top, and I would advise against using the strap for the lunch box. It just can't hold the weight of a loaded lunch and trust me, you will lose the lunchbox! You get what you pay for though, so overall I guess not bad for the cost
I'm planning to use this set to go to South Africa but I only received the 3 suitcases but no travel tote.
Great! I needed a backpack that wasn't too big but would hold a lot. This does the trick. I'm able to put my laptop, a thick novel, a journal, a magazine and toiletries with room. It's not clunky and travels well.
While its not anything special, and i wasn't crazy with the giant logo across the front, it did its job and didn't let any water leak through when I used it.
My kiddo loves it. Holds a good amount of school supplies.
The clasp will not stay closed
Just got this for our next Asia trip. Looks very promising.
Nice fanny pack. Just big enough for my wallet and phone.
Purchased to use with backpacking system. Upon opening I was not impressed as it seems a bit thin on the main arm that extends from the handle to the actual umbrella surface. It is small and compact as described and for the cost may serve the purpose. Will see how it does with wind.
Average quality but my daughter loves it.
I liked that it had numerous pockets of different sizes. I did wish it was just a bit larger. I haven't used it yet so i don't know how durable it is.
ended up being way larger than I thought, even though two sizes. The smaller ones fit my jeans and pants. The larger ones will have to be used on longer trips for my husbands jeans and pants. They are very floppy even when filled unless fully filled. They can be rolled up for storage when not in use.
Like that it is lightweight.Little snug fit for my duplicate checks but is working out fine. Probably should have ordered one with a pen slot but not a dealbreaker.
Very good quality for the price.
My daugther is teenager and hard to close...she said.
I am really liking this bag so far! It has so many pockets which is great for a large family. You can keep all your beach items separated and organized. The cooler is large & can fit snacks and drinks great. The bag itself is really large! perfect for a large family. I also love the the bag is mesh so it folds down nice and compact for easy storage when not in use. The only thing I would ask for is a few more color choices. This color is cute but I would like more options. Overall, a great bag!
exactly the same bag in the picture.
Cute, my only complaint is that is isn't as bright as I'd thought, the material reminds me of a tint. I still like the overall design a lot and would recommend.
Item is as described.
Nice backpack, great compartments for devices and usb cord.
It's a nice bag and good size for me. The leather looks and fels like vinyl...Split leather is a cheaper grade of leather, so it probably shoudl have been expected (I didn't know what split leather was until after I received it and looked it up. I am keeping it and using it, as I like the size, shape, and internal organization, I just wish the leather looked and felt like leather...but to be fair, for the price that might be a lot to ask..
Very nice looking but be warned the fabric is thin.
But it doesn't insulate as much as I'd like. I put a cold pack in the insulated, bottom compartment, along with baby bottles, and I can feel the cold seeping out. Could be a dealbreaker for some, but if you put in more cold packs and won't be out too long, then it should do the job. The tote itself is roomy and well-made.
I was looking for a backpack to carry a 14” laptop and gym stuff including a towel. This fits the bill. The laptop compartment fits the laptop well, with some extra room for my iPad too. Additionally it holds a rolled up bath towel, a bag of gym clothe, and a pair of sneakers on top. Closing requires two hands and somewhat tight with all these as one can imagine. What I don't like: - with the laptop inserted it is not comfortable to wear on my back - I can feel the big flat surface of the laptop - color is not what I had expected for navy blue - see picture - the fabric collects lint like a magnet. Just by setting on my carpet it picks up all the fiber and cat hair. None of my other bags do that Overall I'd say this is a good purified the price. Hope it will last a reasonable amount of time
Great purse/bag. I feel that the cloth is quite durable even though I've only had the bag for about a month. I don't use it often, but it's good to have around when I have it. Great for sneaking in snacks at the movie theater.
exactly what I needed. I keep it in my car for my gym stuff
Surprised my husband with this. I was concerned about the quality but it's actually very nice. A good buy.
Great color! Sturdy handle and the wheels are awesome. Struggling to get the locking system to work properly but not concerned because I will still be able to put my lock on it if need be.
Very nice, the quality is good, just wish it was a little thicker material. But for the price, it's quite nice.
Very cute design. They have held up for at least one trip so far. I just wish there were extra inserts that came with it since I messed up on one of the cards.
Great product but need the larger sizes for more than a week long trips.
Love, Love...Love It! The bag is the perfect size and the graphics is awesome. My son is so happy!
I like that it zips closed and doesn't pull open as I wear it as a back pack. It was a little bit smaller than I was expecting. My phone does not fit in any of the pockets. It works good though. Other customers commented on a smell, but I didn't notice a smell on mine.
I really like this purse. I bought it for travel, but i like the smaller size and cross-body style. I rode an ATV in a downpour and it didn't have colors run from the leather and dried out nicely. The zippers can be a little stiff. Lots of good compartments and pockets and I really like that all exterior pockets have security features to prevent theft.
I did like traveling and checking this bag at the airport because it's so light you can really pack it. The bag size is not eating at your 50 or 70 pound max. I personally ended up needing slightly more space and I did have issues with the bag wanting to flip over and not stay on the wheels so I did return it but I am looking at a bag from the same company with a little more room.
This is a high quality wallet offering RFID protection made by a high quality company. After several months of heavy use this wallet has hardly any wear. Highly recommend buying this wallet. My only issue is something I have found with almost every wallet I've tried which is an issue with the ID window pocket; it is often a bit tricky to get my DL out of this windowed pocket. Other than this minor deficiency I suggest you buy this wallet if you are looking to buy something high quality and want to buy a high quality wallet from a high quality company!
I wish it were lighter and less bulky. I gave this to my husband who does international travels upwards of 70% so something sturdy nut slim and light would have been better he said. Other than that, it's great. Solid construction and good feel to the case.
It is great..appropriate size and everything..seems real sturdy..
The material is actually pretty sturdy however it has a hole in it already after a month of using it. I use it for my Distribution Center job, lots of forklift and loading and unloading trailers. And the drink holders are a wee bit too small regular water bottles have an extremely tight fit, which is good but won't fit anything more than your average plastic water bottle.
Great day purse for traveling, but too small for a travel purse for several days, or a long flight. Will keep but carry in luggage.
Arrived on time. There was no weird smell and nothing has broken. My only complaints are I wish that my phone fit better and it had more card slots.
The canvas material is a bit thin. Already a hole beginning to wear into bottom of bag after only a couple months use. Otherwise great bag.
Very excited to use these packing cubes. When they first arrived I was surprised to see such a small box. When I opened it up all of them were there, just don't take up much space when folded down. The material seems durable enough to pack full without worrying about it breaking open. The drawstring bag will definitely be nice in separating dirty clothes from clean clothes. These are going to work wonders for organizing and keeping things together. Also very happy that they fold down easily for storage reasons when they're not in use.
I want to try something new and so far I do like what I order.
The Garment Bag met all my expectations and was just what I was looking for.
Very good wallet, lots of places to store credit cards
Seems to be constructed well
Cute and compact fits all the cords and extras for my tablet.
Our son really likes the Backpack for preschool. Great material and nice size. The only thing is the area where the Safety Harness part goes ripped off 😭. Update: This wonderful company emailed me and sent our son a new backpack 😍 He was so Excited!!! I as a parent love the fact that the harness on the new backpack is on the backside. Thank you again! You definitely have a returning customer and I will recommend your products to others!
This is a really nice bag. The only problem I have with it is one of the holographic panel things started to peal of after using it for one day. I used some super glue on in and it seems to be holding so far. All in all, I have no regrets buying it.
The only problem is when you unzip it it does not open all the way up
Four stars because the color isn't as bright like the picture shows....
These are well made and easy to use luggage tags. I was looking for red ones which is how these are described, but the color is really orange. So I sent them back. I would have kept them if the color had been accurate.
Nice wallet. The actual clip isn't the best for bills unless you have 15 individual bills which is not often for me. I like I can keep my hotel key in it and it doesn't quit working like my other money clip
better for women than man
While this Titan umbrella does open and close at the push of a button which makes it easy to get on and off trains and in and out of cars, after a while it doesn't close well and you have to do it manually after pressing the button. It is also heavier to carry than the original standard Totes open and close umbrella. I attribute the heavier weight to making the Titan wind-proof, which it truly is, even in cold windy weather in Washington, DC. The regular Totes umbrella was NOT windproof and turned inside out all the time.
Lasted one trip from US to Thailand. They didn't completely wear out but they took a beating and it shows. I gave my sets away and came home empty. I don't think they would have lasted if they took the same beating.
great quality and feels ultra premium
Super cute & easy for little kids to pull around. The inside of the suitcase is a little smaller than expected, but it works out because little ones don't need much clothes.
The zipper pulls are flimsy leather, but the construction is sound and it is lined. Behind the clip I put my aluminum water bottle and that was an unexpected bonus. I also stuck a morale patch on it. I just bought one for a friend, too.
My review is a little skewed: we ordered 4 of these suitcases and only had issues with 1 of them. The black ones handle broke on first use as we were traveling through the airport. We ended up having to push it or have one of our smaller kids push it while we pulled their suitcase. Otherwise, these are the perfect size for kids for travel. They were very easy for them to handle through the airport, navigating the streets of DC and the metro. I would purchase again!
Much nicer than its twin here on Amazon...This one =stiffer and smells like at least "some" of it is real leather
I wanted this purse for the ease of having my bag inspected at shows and concerts. It works well for that. I am careful with the zipper because I think if I am too rough I might have an issue, I don't think it's going to last for years.
I had my eye on this luggage for a while. I wanted hardside, lightweight, spinner luggage and definitely wanted an accessible pocket too. This case meets those parameters. I've carried it onboard for 6 domestic trips and gate checked it once with no troubles. (I have also taken the next size up as checked bag and had no issues) I'm a packing cube user and find this bag a nice size for a week of travel. It should be noted here that I always travel with a down throw which takes up the same amount of space as one or maybe even two outfits. The side of the bag with the outside pocket must not be over-packed if you want to carry your laptop in that pocket without the chance of damage. It is not the type of suitcase that is easy to "live" out of due to the nature of hardside cases where the zipper splits the case in the middle. Which means that you need a large surface to open the case flat. (Usually, the floor) Take that into consideration when deciding between hard or soft side luggage. I rated 4 stars because of the deceptive space available (due to the outside pocket). Everything else about the case has been spot on for me. (Pictures are at a United Airlines baggage sizer)
Good size check-in luggage. I have used it a several times. It does not roll as smoothly on carpet but no biggy because it is light enough to pull. The handle does not feel sturdy but it works (hence the 4 star rating) Overall i am happy with my purchase.
Lightweight when you unfold it out.. yet when you compact it.. it tends to be heavier than usual...
I like this key organizer. It's my first time having one and I was very pleased with how durable it is and how many keys fit on it. The only thing I have to say that I found wrong is that the screw keeps getting loose unless u tighten it down hard but if u tighten it that much then it's hard to move the keys so you have to leave it semi-tight even with the spacers.
Bought these shelves for our van, have not installed them yet but think they will work well. For traveling on a plane they seem heavy. That being said, they are great for keeping clothes from shifting in your suitcase and getting wrinkled. Nice product and good value.
Super cute and shiny af lol. My lil mama loves it! But one of the pom poms fell off already so now I gotta find my sewing kit. But nbd she loves it so that's all I care about!
Very nice wallet, very impressed
Used at a conference
I got this to use everyday. It has a lot of space. I can put my wallet and cell phone. On certain days, i can also add a supply cup, wipes, and 3 diapers. And still have room. Light weight.
The instructions on setting the combination are plain awful. I certainly hope the locks are better than the instructions.
It's not amazing but a good value for the price. I had to share it with my sister, so it was not quite as big as I would like. For a single person use I think it would be fine though. I love how many pockets it has. Overall it was a good purchase just wish it was a little bigger.
Love this backpack! It is perfect for our trips to the amusement parks where they make you take out everything for security. I know its not the best thing to have all your business out in the open. But if gets me out of those long security lines much faster I don't care who sees all our snacks. It is made of very heavy duty plastic - I'm never afraid of if breaking and helps when we got caught in the rain. It is a little stiff at first but after a couple of uses it got more flexible and easy to open and close. Overall I'm impressed with the quality for the price. And its very convenient!
zippers quality is not that great
A bit pricey for what you get but it's a nice card organizer & holder.
cute little umbrella but only big enough for one person.
Cute and well made for the price!
Smaller than I expected but the pattern is so cute and quality is great
This was a great product for my last tourist trip to Europe. More convenient than an around-the-neck wallet... It was easy to slide between my shorts and my underwear but still fairly accessible under my untucked shirt. Cutting one of the zipper pulls made it easier to tell the difference between the two pockets. (I rarely give five-star reviews because I want to give even an excellent product time to earn its fifth star.)
I really liked it, I took it on my trip to Israel. I could fit my clothes in it for the next day. It said it would come with two straps (like a backpack) it only came with one strap and was a cross body. I have back issues, so having one strap didn't help and would cause pain if I was carrying it for too long. But overall fit a decent amount of things
This bag looks just like the picture and is the perfect size. I just wish the outer zipper pocket held an Iphone 6plus. No worries though, there are plenty of pockets. I also love the way it converts easily to a cross the shoulder bag.
Great size & quality. Seems like it will be very secure. Bought for trip to Rome.
Very cute. Lovely umbrella!
I bought this for my 1 year old son who loves dinosaurs. We are using this as his diaper bag and it is just big enough for 6 diapers and a pack pamper wipes. I love this we ordered the toddler and the straps are adjustable! great buy.
Good quality showed up on time but a little big for a toddler, probably good for like a 5/6 year old. It's a good backpack just bigger than I expected.
Good quality! Faded fast but still looks and works well!
Took this on a cruise and it held all snorkeling gear, a life vest towels and dry clothes
The backpack is vibrant in color, durable and inexpensive. My 5 year old daughter uses it for camp and its perfect. Might be a tad too small for school because of the binders they have to carry but its great for camp and travel.
Would be better if a little bit bigger and more sturdy. Shipped fast though.
This is my go to wallet. I love how low profile it is and it's easy to fit into my pocket or clip onto my lanyard. The clip did come undone and fall off my lanyard once but I recommend attaching the chain to something sturdier.
When my wallet arrived, the screwdriver was not included in the box like it says in the description. Other than that, the wallet looks and does what was promised.
slightly thicker than what I expected, but still happy.
Nice piece of luggage for the price I bought it for my granddaughter and work perfect for her
Great size for the gym. My everyday bag. Not heavy on the shoulder.. the down fall is the zipper keeps popping off. Getting a lot of compliments
I like the whole idea about these packing cubes and can't wait to try them after seeing a review on them on YouTube. I think they will be very handy so I don't have to dig through my suitcase and mess everything up.
Nice school backpack. I thought it is small and initially bought it for my three year old. It is a big backup, works for kids around 7 years age. I might have to get a new bag for my three year old, because it is too big for him. But the quality and look is really good
Its bigger than I though. I have 2 passports and they fit perfectly. If your phone has a case, its very difficult to slide it in. I doubt it has RFID blocking to be honest, but its very cute.
This bag is very well put together. There are many pockets and the bag itself seems real durable. The only downside I see is that it attaches separately to the rolling cart, whereas the top connects, I cannot see how the bottom does so the bag is loose on the trolley. Other than that, my 5 year old loves it.
Good wallet. I like it a lot and it worked well for my trip and everyday life. My only gripe is it can be really hard to get credit cards out of the slots, especially the ID card slot, but I guess at least that means they won't fall out!
I ordered two to store seasonal clothing. Love all the compartments! I'm not disappointed.
All around great pack, especially for less than $50. No complaints here. Product as described and shown, NICE.
Fits great! Adjustable belt. Lots of pockets for storage of money ect.
I love this. But I can't use it, and here are the reasons: PROS: -Color true to the picture. -Arrived on time with no scratches. -Closes perfectly (not loose like some flimsy stuff). CONS: -the bag part is veryyyy small and would only hold a phone . It should be called a belt with storage but definitely NOT a bag of any sort. So, I was going to wear this on my trip to the beach but it didn't fit anything and I had to carry my big bag to be able to hold some cards.... I still loveit and wear it as a belt = )
Love the luggage tag, its for a gift for my nieces first trip, she hasnt seen it yet, but I know she will love it. I wish it came in more colors, it only showed neutral colors, but its good. No real complaints, came very quickly, the company seems very interested in our satisfaction which is great. Love a company willing to stand behind its products.
Super cute, quality is good. Our kiddo is using it for preschool and it works perfectly for that.
It's a nice little bag but the zipper broke after less than 3 months.
Nice bag. A bit smaller than anticipated, but sufficient for a small laptop or tablet.
It is very well made. I'll come back later to review it after I use it on a foreign trip in the near future.
This bag has a good quality material, I'm surprised the size is a good size. Perfect for a weekend get away!
This bag fits nicely under the seat or at your feet in the car. It has multiple pockets for easy access to your phone, water bottle, etc. The interior of the bag holds make-up, medical supplies, books, etc. It's deceivingly "large" due to it's configuration and pockets. I am not searching or fumbling for items, therefore, not annoying the person sitting next to me. Best of all it has a built-in strap at the back, so it slides right on top of another suitcase or carry-on.
I absolutely love this bag. I'm hoping to get another one on Prime Day!
I ordered this shoulder strap to replace a missing strap on a bag. It works well, is very sturdy and seems to be of good quality. I am using it regularly, and it works great
Perfect size for the pool!
I bought it for a tent bag and it worked out great
This is over any expectations!! I was looking for a decent bag all over $100. The leather really nice genuine and thick. For the price it's great deal. This one Even better than Aldo bags. Thanks to the brand
I was looking fo a new carryon with.a trolley sleeve, because for those who are familiar with multiple legs of travel, running for a train with multiple bags is difficult to maneuver. My criteria was it had to have a trolley sleeve, be stylish and versatile enough to bring to the beach, roomy enough to fit my travel pillow, accessories, food and change of clothes, and zippered so my stuff doesn't fall out. This met all the criteria and I also loved that it has a flat bottom and is easy to clean, because I will be stowing this under the seat in front of me and we all know how disgustingly dirty planes are. The trolley sleeve keeps the bag together with the main bag more securely, so I can't wait to try this out. Some reviews have said it doesn't fit over the handle, but this is not a problem with my Eagle Creek roller bag. The only thing I think I would change are the handles, because they are kind of thin and may hurt if carrying heavier stuff as a tote, but I can deal with it and my solution would be to slip on some padded sleeves on the handle.
This is so great! Supreme quality, sooo cute, and my daughter loves it.
This thing is suuuuper high quality for the price. The outer canvas and the inner material (luxurious af) feel pretty durable. It's a little smaller than a regular school backpack, but still perfect size to fit a 13" MacBook Pro, spiral notebooks, standard folders, iPad, all the normal stuff. The belt things on the front look cool and pop open with magnetic rivets so you don't have to deal with belt buckle nonsense. Lots of pockets of various sizes, AND THE CUPHOLDER. Lemme tell ya, the cupholder thing on the side is a nice thick elastic mesh that holds any regular water bottle snug. Dank bag, buy it.
The travel wallet easily carried my passport, as well as, credit card and cash. Access to each item was easy. although it is lightweight, I personally have a hard time with weight around my neck and so I always wore a blouse/top with a collar to ease the pressure. So far it is traveling well and no show of wearing out.
the size is relatively small to a man but it is perfect for my wife. she uses it as a diaper bag. when we are going out, she put the go pro in it in case there is raining day. also the diapers, bottles, all the stuff the baby girl need. it has one front pocket and the main pocket, in the main pocket there is "fence" so you could put a wallet or doc there. we are really satisfied with this product.
Seems to fit the necessary items for gymnastics, but it isn't as light weight as we expected.
Very compact. Got all my cards, and cash in this wallet and it is much thinner than my old traditional wallet.
This thing is both precious and perfect. Well made, super cute, lots of space. I love it to death already! The little snake is great.
We Bought this for our Granddaughter. She likes it. Very small and nice for a preschooler.
Great quality feel. Small bag great for transportation drivers. Hold more than I thought neatly and on body securely.
Great sturdy umbrella. Just what my daughter was looking for.
I bought the brown passport for my husband and the blue passport for myself and love them. The brown is very rich in color and so is the blue. These are a very good buy!
I receive compliments everywhere I go. The luggage in not only adorable, it is roomy, functional and classy!
Bought one for everyone for our trip to Disney. Worked great had a place for our water and enough room for snacks but small enough not to bother anyone.
Works great. I'm happy with it.
Have two other checkbook covers from this seller. Love the quality and the embossed designs. Very durable. Have two other covers from this seller that are over two years old for other accounts. Love the embossed graphics and variety of designs and colors. They are very sturdy and durable.
Bought for my mom for when she travels. Very useful, has several pockets inside for cards and to put your passport. It has a zip to close the wallet. Material seems good quality. So, with heavy daily use, this thing has been a great value for as useful as it is. And it still looks great, too.
She has used it already- works great love it!
Very nice my daughter loved it.
I bought 3, one for each child. They take a beating, are a good size and keep things cool with an ice pack. They rinse out and dry easily.
Bought for daughter to use at horse shows to keep her show clothes clean. Works great! Quality seems to be good. Love the pockets on the backside! My daughter is able to keep her hair items, along with emergency supplies in the pockets.
Love this little case! Perfect for carrying a small amount of different medications. Allergy pills, ibuprofen, etc all go into their own “little” section. The tops do not pop open spilling your meds everywhere, definitely another big plus!
Great buy. Perfect for what I needed it for.
perfect, it fits well, adjustable, good quality. no complaints
Super convenient to open with the button on the handle. Large enough for two person. Good quality with solid materials.
Works well with my husband's CPAP equipment. Sleek, reserved, understated, nice item.
Amazing. My turkey neck disappears as long as I have one of these on.
Gave as a gift and my son in law loved it.
This backpack is a really nice size. Not too big or too small. Many pockets and great straps. Lightweight and comfortable. Love that it is a crossbody. Unisex and great for all.
The only bag on Amazon i could find with actual functional straps! I love it, suprisingly well made for an amazon backpack.
Love this nail file!
Compact size that still accommodated all of my cards. Looks nice too.
Excellent! Stylish and durable! Plenty of room and different compartments. Especially love the small bag for weekend trips.
Loved this bag! I took an extra clip on my trip based on reviews in case mine broke but it actually held up fine. It is the perfect size for me. My phone, disinfectant, gum, credit cards, money, pen, lipgloss and sunglasses easily fit. I also fit a map in the front pocket. My sister thought it was too small and she had a larger Travelon bag that she used. I highly recommend it for people who like to have small, minimal bags for trips.
I like this product very much, its big bag can be compressed. Compared to other brands of products, it can hold more clothes, like it
Great back oak and perfect size. Very soft and lots of room. Excellent seller. Thanks!!!
My daughter is so happy
I still use this as my everyday wallet. Only thing I dislike is that it gets stuck in a regular back pocket.
I like the sturdiness and quality of the backpack. I gave them to my grandchildren for school and let them use small hand bag for their lunchbox.
Used as a retirement gift. I had coworkers sign the bag with fabric markers to give at her farewell. She loved it.
This is a great backpack. The material feels strong and highly quality – just like any well-made backpack I've used over the years. And it holds a 13" MacBook Pro with room for other things also. I got the navy color, and like it a lot. Would definitely recommend. It's exactly what I was hoping it would be.
This umbrella is easy to store. I also love this auto open and close button. The rainbow color is so cute. Can be used by anyone. The quality of this umbrella is sturdy.
You can insert more than one card in each slot, so it hold alot. The best part is how beautiful this wallet is.
The bag was delivered on time. I didn't know what to expect, but I'll say I was pleasantly surprised. The material is a little thin for my liking, but so far, it appears and seems to be very sturdy. I'm a truck driver, so I spend Sunday night through Friday morning on the road. It's large enough that I can take 6 outfits, underwear and socks. I can also use the pouch on the inside for my toiletries. The shoulder strap isn't very comfortable, but it'll do. I would recommend.
Funniest gag gift ever! Looks like real tummy. My friends are asking where I got it. Hilarious.
Bought this as a gift for my mom, she usually travels to visit me and always complained about her carry on suitcase - too bulky and hard to put up in the airplane stowaway by herself. She loves having the backpack for easy maneuvering around the airport but still all the great pockets to keep your things organized as you travel
Expands soo much, I fit a ridiculous amount of stuff in it. Love the design. Comfortable to wear even when it's heavy.
Really surprised at the quality and care of manufacturing. Thoughtful design and appearance. So many compartments that can be used for just about anything. It is really well made.
LOVE this pack!! Perfect for larger iphone which is what I was looking for. Not thick and bulky like other packs.
Great Purse Organizer!
great product, great quality---I'll be purchasing all future umbrellas here!
Good size bag with shoulder access. It can contain slot of thing. Good quality and easy to clean.
So cool! Good price. Good quality. Arrived promptly. We love it!
Didn't know what to expect but I love this wallet. Kinda big for the pocket. But I like holding it with my cellphone.
Our youngest of 3 children is almost 5, allowing us to travel again without packing so much gear. We bought 5 carryon suitcases,these straps for are readily adjustable to fit snuggly carry-on bags. These are perfect for quick ID of your bags even if you don't check your bags, TSA check point, restroom, waiting in food court, etc.
My baby girl loves it well made
Great for keeping organized. Made packing much easier. Bought 5 sets (different colors) so I am able to pack for 4 kids in less suitcases and they know their stuff is in their particular colored cubes.
Very impressed with this little bag. Just the right size for a weekend trip and high quality.
This is a sturdy set of tags that is great for labeling your luggage. I love the color and it stands out from the rest making it easier to identify which is yours.
Keeps everything in and nice quality
I am happy with my purchase. I have been using money clips for over a decade and this one feels very sturdy and has a good color. I think it is work it.
Bought for my grandson and he loves it.
It's perfect! Add a cute little keychain to it you'll be set. Very closely colored and textured like LV
Grandson loved this for his first day of preschool
Perfect as a personal item. NOT considered a carry on and you won't be charged for it! Wonderful when flying certain carriers that charge for everything!
These are the coolest luggage tags. I've had lots of luggage tags over the years and none were as good as these. First, the metal loop won't break; second, it's a color that stands out from the luggage; third, you could put it on a backpack or anything you'd like to identify as yours. And last, your I.D. information is protected from being easily copied by someone, and it won't wear off.
This bag has replaced my gym bag and racquetball bag by being large enough to do both tasks. As another review mentioned, it would be nice to get more compartments to separate dirty items, but it's a minor detail that's more of a preference. I just make sure to take out sweaty clothes and headbands each day after playing. My storage system is: keys/phone/wallet in the small outside pocket. Gloves on the outside glove line. Shoes in the vented shoe pocket. Racquet (x2) in the racquet pouch. Sweatbands, balls, clothes in the main bag area. Eye protection in the eyewear pocket. It has worked great for me!
This bag fits so much, I have used it for a weekend bag and took on the airplane this summer. Has so many storage compartments and just when I thought I found them all more showed up. Love the color. Only thing that would make it even better would be 360 wheels but didn't have any problems maneuvering it around.
Easy to quickly ID locker in my gym. Easy to set combination. Very sturdy. Easy to use. Good Price. Could not find this in any "brick and mortar" hardware-target-walmart-bed & bath -home improvement store.
Sturdy material, super cute. Our daughter was thrilled with this bag!
This is a pretty standard duffel bag with two distinguishing features. First, it is bigger than most duffel bags. You can carry a lot of gear in this thing. My kids take it for school camps and you can get all their clothes and equipment in plus their sleeping bag and a pillow. Secondly, it is well made. The fabric is thick and the rings where the handle attaches are metal. So it is useful and it will last a long time, that is really all you can ask for in a duffel bag.
Purchased for 5 year-old to use for trips to Grandma's. She loves it and it fits her clothes and favorite doll.
Love it on are probably by the larger size later.
We are a couple months into school and this bag still looks brand new for my fourth grader.
Great leather, well needed
I love this! It's small, one person only, and provides shade and protection from rain. I use shade umbrellas mostly for theme park days and long days at the beach or park and this is my favorite personal umbrella!
We love using this timer lock for lots of different purposes. If the lock battery dies, it immediately unlocks which is a great feature!
I recently had to replace my previous Bago bag after 5 years of great use. I never travel without having my Bago Bag. It fits in the front compartment of my international carry-on. I can go almost anywhere without ever paying for bags. When I buy cool stuff, I can always bring it back because the bag is very spacious and always holds what I need. It is also great a Christmas time when you get those unexpected gifts you need to take back on the airplane.
Soft foldable fabric washes great and looks good. Great quality.
It's a little smaller than I wanted but I still love It!!!
Bought for work, just got it a couple of days ago. Can't comment on durability yet, but feels like a good product.
This is the first time I used this type of product. Very easy to use and afforded me much more room in my luggage. For anyone who travels a lot, these are very useful as less luggage is needed.
Looks amazing and on time delivery
Cute design and perfect size.
My two year old has a new favorite backpack!! He wears it around the house roaring like a Dino. So glad it is plush bc he wrestles with his daddy wearing it bc that is what a Dino does :)
Nice fold able bag. It starts out the size of a clutch. I have this in another bag we go to conference in and if we get extra items through out the day, its great to whip this out and have another bag available. Also good for trip so you have an extra carry on if needed.
I love this phone case. I have a galaxy s7 edge and this case fits it perfectly good quality graphics on the cat s and it even came with a stylus. Item came on time and is good quality for the price.
This bag is incredible. Simple, gender-neutral, durable, and looks so good. It also is the perfect size for me -- just tall enough to fit a disposable water bottle, but still small enough to be convenient. The strap is a nice width and is very durable as well, and the brown leather is just fantastic. Inside there is an additional small zippable pocket and a small pouch (like a pocket without a zipper) too, which are also useful. I have zero complaints. 10/10, highly recommended.
Great quality, great price.
I love it. Well made and the pockets are great for organizing. Very comfortable and beautiful.
Unicorns are her favorite so the assortment of what was bundled here was perfect!
Exactly what I wanted
I didn't want anything to bulky For just my keys and wallet. This worked out perfectly for that with a little room to spare. Well built in a great deal for the price
The colors r beautiful and the length of strap is great but the blue jean top part that closes it , is somewhat a big flap , I d like jean flap to be smaller.
I took a trip to Belize for 10 days and packed it all in a carry-on with these awesome cubes!
Its literally as practical as you can get. Its perfectly sized, in my opinion
Love the colors of this carry on...Bright and cheerful, airline approved for maximum packing!
Doing a back to school event. They turned out better than expected for the price.
Grandson loved this!!!
My son loves his backpack . The size is just perfect and comfy for kids .
Backpacked europe for ten days with this and was great. Affordable and nice design!
This is great for small trip! For anyone who loves to travel, or even camp this can be highly useful. You can fit all of your necessities into this bag and it doesn't take up much space. Definitely will continue to use for my all future trips.
I ADORE this bag, it's one of the best bag purchases I've ever made. It's super cute (I got the navy w/ polka dots), lightweight, sturdy, and the perfect size for an overnight bag or an under seat carry on. I can completely (over)stuff it and it holds everything no problem, the quality is awesome and way better than I would expect for the the price. The small pockets inside are great for keeping small important things organized and the handle pocket and pouch is super helpful, I can hook it to my suitcase and keep my phone and computer chargers handy. I bought it for a trip with a 6-8 hour flight and it fit perfect my under the seat, even though it was completely stuffed full, and I've since used it many times as an overnight bag. I highly recommend this bag, it's fantastic.
It's very cute, my daughter loves it
Bought for a gift for my mother and she loves it! Has enough storage and very durable.
I needed something comfortable yet rugged for my outdoor lifestyle. This is perfect. Lots of pockets, tough as nails, easy to clean. Love it
Perfect size for running around Europe. Love this backpack. Good quality.
Great product simple meets my needs
Perfect size for a carry on. Fit everything and I don't have probelm.
This bag is true to the description. It is well made. It reflects care in the details. Packaged well, beautiful leather, good quality. I would recommend this bag.
Very happy customer. Well manufactured.
Great for our beginning of school supply give away. There are so many children in need.
I'm all about a minimalist wallet. My last one I had for years was leather rfid by travelon and yeah it was a huge game changer when I got it but it's seen better days... kinda had this stench for awhile too I've ignored until finding one worth replacing it with. Insert this one: It's water resistant!!! (excellent against sweat if you stash it at your hip like me ;) And surprisingly, I prefer the single pocket- satisfies that desire for simplicity. Feels sturdy, lil bit hipster. I'm happy :)
For travel and everyday use this bag is superior! I started by using it just for travel, but I keep using it more and more for every day. I could have used a few more credit card slots, but it's perfect in other ways. There are pockets galore on the outside and inside! Designed very well. The strap is very adjustable and it is reinforced with a wire or something (?) so it cannot be cut. Also some pockets can be "locked" making it harder for pickpockets to get into the bag. The price of the bag is reasonable for all you get. Love it!!!!
It's good. Has a perfect size. It can be used as a bag or to organize stuff inside your luggage. I don't feel its weight so, it's perfect for traveling
Really impressed with this purchase! came in a nice, sturdy gift box and the cover itself inside was also wrapped in a nice wrap, so presentation value is great! the quality is high of the leather and the cover, i was very pleasantly surprised and will probably get more as gifts to give!
I'm so impressed with this backpack!!! The quality is top notch and I love the tanned leather details on it. Snaps work great. It's bigger than I thought it would be and the color is even better in person.
If you're flying Spirit get this! Perfect size for their personal item. Love this bag!
Very happy with this purchase. Smooth easy rolling at the airport
Bought this to use as a tennis bag and I love it!!
I purchased the lime green and it definitely stands out as suitcases come around the airport luggage carousel. Any tag is only as good as it's attaching device and I'm happy to say these wire type clasps have held up to multiple plane trips, including a trip to and from Asia. Very pleased with this purchase.
Very sturdy and spacious duffel bag. Plenty of pockets and super lightweight. The shoulder strap is durable and well cushioned for support
great wallet very soft and beautiful.
It was just as described and the perfect size for a toddler. The surface has a slight sheen. Pretty!
Have not gone on my trip yet but these locks look well built and should do the trick. I got orange in the hope that it will make claiming my luggage a little easier.
It's very lightweight and can carry a lot. They is a Velcro pad which wraps around the two handle straps making it very comfortable to carry. This bag would be good for travel shopping as it folds up into a very small piece. Just started using it so can't assess the durability but appears well made.
These packing cubes are fantastic. I am amazed at how much you can pack in these cubes. Because we are taking a 15 day cruise, we needed more clothing than usual, so I bought two sets to accommodate everything I wanted to take. I got it all in and the suitcase weight came in lower than the 50 lbs we are allowed. I highly recommend these. I don't know how wrinkled our clothes will be when we reach our destination, but we would have wrinkled clothing anyway. So that's not a serious consideration for me.
For the price I thought it would have so many issues or be poor quality but this was one of the best tactical bags I've bought for that price range. Its perfect size for any hike and the durability is top notch. Cant go wrong with this product!
Returned for same product different color
Excellent for the price
I'm a flight attendant and can tell you this bag is worth the money. It has held up to my heavy use for over a year now. I can fit one set of clothes, pjs, personal items needed to "get ready" in the morning and a few miscellaneous items into the bag. It fits under the seat or in the overhead. I get lots of compliments from fellow crew members. They all want to know where I got it so they can get one also. Sturdy and user friendly. Buy this one today!!!!!
Looks exactly like the picture. Great adjustable length for any body type. Lots of compartments for your items
my daughter love it and using it almost everyday.
Perfect for daycare/ preschool and traveling. Big deep open pocket and small pocket in front.
This wallet is very sturdy, the card slots are great, not to bulky in a medium size purse.
This backpack is full size (which I always have a hard time figuring out online). It has lots of storage: Water bottle pockets on both sides on the outside; Inside the main big part, there is a slot that holds full size folders and there's also a smaller zippered pouch on the opposite side; On the back of the backpack there is also a small zippered pouch; The front zippered pocket has 2 pen pockets and an additional pocket (maybe for a phone?). I've included a picture of it on my 6-year-old.
Fits plenty of clothing and personal items. Wheels work great, very sturdy and durable. Highly recommend.
Very compact, but roomy enough to hold all my credit cards, some cash and my driver's license, but still fit comfortably in my pants pocket. Really like the fact that it has the information protection (RFID). Very pleased with the quality. Vendor has had correspondence twice already and is very eager to please the customer. I would definitely purchase this product and purchase from this vendor again!
Real nice bag, lots of room
Bought this for a music festival in November, it was very light and is super easy to use! Best value I found in Amazon
The outside pockets are the right size for my phone and credit card case. Have plenty of room inside to throw in a book or two when traveling.
item was a great buy i have twin daughters that just started pre k and they loved them!!! back pack looked better than pictured has a glitter finish that photo really doesnt do it justice
so fabulous, I like.the material! it's perfect for EDM rave parties! the quality if pretty good, and it's great that the fanny pack is water proof.
This backpack has worked great for my pre-schooler! More than half a year done with school and it still looks brand new.
Great bag... just wish it had an extra pocket inside.
I give this 5 stars because it's exactly what I wanted. The material isn't anything luxurious, but it's quality enough. I was packing for a long trip with lots of gifts. I definitely will buy again and recommend to friends and family.
My daughter reported that she stopped having back pains from heavy textbooks because of the design of this bag.
So. I've been using this backpack for about a week now, And WOW! I really like this thing! First of all, it has PLENTY of space For Whatever you need And isn't bulky like most other backpacks I have used! It Collapses nice and small whenever it isn't full! It has plenty of Pockets on the first zipper to put all my gadgets in! And the second zipper has Room for all the big stuff! The Back And the straps are padded with thick foam, and is vented so it doesn't sweat Like most others! I Love all the Straps that are ALL over this thing! it even has a Velcro Patch for a cool badge ! Really good overall Quality Backpack! Would Recommend to Anyone looking for a Heavy Duty Backpack!
Traveled with my 11 year old twice already and the suitcase is like new.
Nice li'l carryon or weekend bag, can cram a surprising amount in it.
Daughter uses for school, loads it up with books, works great. Sturdy. Good quality.
Loved it very well made
Amazing quality brushes. They apply nicely and are easy to clean. I have not experienced any shedding. Be careful not to pull on the brushes too hard though, because they are not tightly attached and the wooden brush will come apart from the plastic handle. I am thoroughly pleased.
It glides down the airport. awesome wheels and good protection.
Really cute bag! I use it all the time and it's big enough to hold all of my everyday things.
My 7 year old picked out this backpack and loves it.
Perfect for bills and loose change. Stays shut well so have used for pills without issue.
Very Cute & Great Quality!
Keeps the rain off. Waterproof. Good quality
Love these straps to easily spot our luggage
This bag is AMAZING, I was worried it wouldn't be good quality for all the heavy stuff I have to carry around with me since I am a college student but it is so heavy duty. The price is right and it's so cute and fashionable.
This is a very good drawstring bag. It is very good to use for trips and for use in school. This is a very spacious backpack and has a lot of zippers and pockets to put items in. The main pocket could fit up to a whole basketball worth of space. The material is very nice and is waterproof. This backpack is sturdy and could last a long period of time.
I packed lots of stuff thinking I might need to use the expansion feature but was surprised to find out that I did not. As I was attending a wedding and had two formal dresses in this suitcase, I was expecting to have to do some ironing when I got there but was also surprised that I did not. Of course I had to pat myself on the back for an outstanding job of packing, non the less I have to attribute some credit to the excellent design of this suitcase which looks small but is deceptively roomy. I took a lot of time researching travel-ware online and was very happy with my decision. I cannot comment on durability because this was the first time I had used it; but fully expect to be travelling with it for a long time.
Zipper is good. Keep wallet closed nicely even when stuffed. Will buy again
I gave this to my elderly parents and they loved it. It's light weight and easy to maneuver. Even though they decided not to travel they refused to return the product!
Got this for a trip in a city famous for pick pockets and thieves. It's the perfect size for day or evening and fit almost everything I needed. I was surprised at how roomy it was - only struggled with fitting a phone and hair clip at the same time (but still managed it!). The locking zippers can be a bit clumsy if you go into your purse often, but were a nice touch that made me feel safer.
Pretty sturdy and works great for stadiums
Great product. I would highly recommend. It measures even temperature.
The bag looks nice, but the hanger strap broke as soon as I tried to hang it up. There wasn't even a dress in the bag.
Loved this hat for my lil guy! He looks so dang adorable in it.
Bought this bag as a gift for my brother and he LOVES it!!!
I recently had a two day trip to the West Coast and got the opportunity to use my new Polare Duffel Bag - what can I say, another great quality product, very utilitarian, spacious and plenty of room for my clothes and accessories. I carried it on the plane, received a couple comments on how nice the bag looked. Looks and functionality, what more could you ask for..... Thanks Polare for another great product experience.
Have used Eagle Creek bags for years and decided to buy a new set. Worked as I expected. Great product.
Came really fast. Good quality.
Great gym bag after one month. Size is perfect 👍🏻
Good quality and fit. Not overly bulky but has Durability enough for an 8 yr old boy. I would purchase again,especially if it was at a reduced special price like the one I purchased. WHAT A DEAL!
I have been searching for months for an overnight/carry-on bag that is big enough to hold all my stuff yet doesn't look like a giant gym duffel bag. This bag is PERFECT. It has lots of room and plenty of pockets (pockets!), and the material colors are vibrant. I love this bag!
I like the size of the backpack and it doesn't look as cheap as it looks online.
Quality of material and attention to details
light, efficient as I wanted it to be. Very good.
This is such a great bag I'm happy I didn't get the same old backpack everything fits in here my iPad my iPhone XR, Books you name it and a great reason a price 5 across-the-board
I just mine and I love it so far. It's so pretty and seems durable. It's also a nice soft material and the drawstring handles work smoothly.
This is going to be great for our upcoming trip to Europe next month! I love that it fits all our passports, cards, boarding passes, keys and all other travel docs we need. I can now keep everything in one place for easy access.
I really like it I use it everyday it's very convenient for me I have diapers and clothes for my kids just so you did just to Grab & Go
I love the bag! it's a good quality fabric, not too big, not too small. I love that it has so many pockets, that's exactly what I was missing in my previous bag!
“Received items and they were as expected. Good quality.”
Arrived on time. Very good product!
Great item at a great price. I have used it to travel several times.
It looks great and good material
best feature about this umbrella is that the kids can see through as they walk and stay dry! They love using this style umbrella for this reason. Very satisfied.
Perfect for your LV neverfull. I didn't carry my purse as often bc everything fell to the bottom. I put this in my bag with the compartments. It's awesome. Everyone that carries big bags should use an organizer like this.
Bought this wallet for my cousin who just started college. It is for her so she can keep her college ID, bus pass, and other necessary cards in place and close to her. Just have to add a lanyard and you are good to go.
I love this bag, it is so fun and useful. Seller is awesome and responds quickly to any questions you may have. Thanks again for awesome service and products.
Great to use an elegant product
I was surprised by how much I was able to pack in these cubes. I used all of the cubes and they all fit neatly in my large suitcase. Since I am going on my trip tomorrow, I have not found out if my outfits were wrinkled or not and what kind of a mess the airlines people will do with the cubes.
Got this for my stepdaughter and she loves it. Very nice Gucci dupe.
I thought for sure the suitcase was going to fall apart with valet checking and being super full, but it surprisingly held up well and it's super cute
Looks exactly as pictured!
I liked the rose gold color of mine and the slim look. It's also secure with what you need instead of digging around in a purse which I love! It's durable and stylish for girls too.
Just what I needed for my trip abroad. Nice and roomy for all my stuff.
I keep this in my large suitcase to strap on my carry on to make the walk to the check in and from the baggage claim easier. Works great and can quickly attach.
Great product for the money
I travel for work for a couple of nights at a time and bought this suitcase to make it easier to get in and out of the plane/car. It has plenty of space to fit a few outfits and a pair or two of shoes along with toiletries, front pockets fit my laptop and an iPad with a padfolio. The extra space for battery has been great (you do need to purchase a separate battery though). Special note to the telescoping handle and the wheels - I've tried a variety of suitcases and this one seems to have it figured out! The handle is very easy to adjust to just the right height and the suitcase glides as it rolls any which way you need it to. I've had several colleagues command my choice of the suitcase. It is far from being the cheapest, but in my opinion absolutely well worth the price! It fits into any overhead compartment just perfectly both on domestic and international flights, so you won't have to worry about checking it! Highly recommend!
Really excited about this bag! I'm going to be using as a gift and I know they will love it! Perfect gym bag, and or carry on for anyone who travels a lot! Great color, lots of room, side pocket for water bottle!
Great product, very comfortable, everything fits.
Item just as described. Nice long telescoping handle. Lots of pockets on the outside for plenty of storage. Laptop bag fits nicely around it and usually can be strapped if the laptop bag has a strap. Blue is a great unisex color, too. This size should be able to be used as a carry on and stowed in the overhead bins. Would buy again. Honest review/no compensation.
Great, sturdy, light bag. Solid construction. I tossed it in my last trip to London. Needed to go to Belfast for a few days and decided to use this bag for the short hop instead of carrying my suitcase. Worked perfectly. Seems water proof and hard to get dirty, easy to fold back to a small flat shape . A great buy for the price.
This belt is very good. The only downside is the size of the zipper pull. It sticks out kinda far. But not a big deal if it bugs me I'll go to a seamstress & have it replaced.
I love the color I got...it's more of a teal than green and really gorgeous. The only thing I wish was different is...could you make the plastic window clear so you can see through it...I like to put my driver's license in these slots. Enough credit card slots for me and I like the size.
Comfortable, good looking, well contructed wallet with plenty of room for cards, etc.
Excellent leather bag. Smells for first 2 days but later no issues
Used to store off season items. Great for space. Allows me to pack more items in to less space.
Love the color works well
These backpacks are really nice. They seem durable. I will be ordering these again for my youth basketball players.
It's one of the few suitcases without a zipper. If you think you need a zipper either buy a bigger suitcase or carry less (same thing with your clothes).The zipper is the most repaired item on the suitcase.
I use it for work as a Train Operator and its able to hold all the books and tools without a problem. It has many side areas for easy access as well to things like a phone charger or water bottles.
Great quality. It lasted the whole school year for a rough first grader.
Great umbrella. Just moved to an area that gets monsoons, so needed a sturdy umbrella instead of a lightweight one. This umbrella has a nice weight to it, is easy to open and resold, and is strong against the weather.
Great luggage for the money . It seems well built and is very attractive . Nice and roomy for men's clothing which tends to be much larger than women's . Light weight so when you pack ,you can still pick it up .
I own a few of the other pieces and I love it.
Like it but to small
Awsome product. Very good. Feels like a raincoat and not like other regular umbrella that gets wet.
One of the best bags I've purchased!
Great quality leather wallet. The zippers are very sturdy and open easily. My husband loves the look and style. It holds all of his cards and his money very well.
This is a nice, lightweight backpack especially good for walking or bike riding or as an alternative to a purse. It has a roomy interior, strategically placed outer compartments and best of all, it can be folded and stored in its own attached case.
We used this bag for a trip to Barcelona to take with us everyday for all our essentials. Appreciate the sturdy material and the comfortable cross body design. Also felt secure in a new city. Hidden compartments are perfect for keeping cash.
Very nice leather, and well made. Looks nice and is very functional. Straps adjust nicely, and the pockets are easy to access. I am particular about my leather goods. This has a nice finish, heavy (as in thick but not heavy to carry), and uniform so it appears to be top grain. With top grain you get no blemishes from nature. You just need to worry about how it holds up over time as it gets nicked, dragged against things, scrapped, etc. Time will tell and I will update this review as needed. The interior is lined nicely. It looks like a bag easily twice the price.
My sister loved it! Plenty of room!
Exactly like the picture, great material and quality.
My daughter loves this polish. It's great for kids because it dries fast. It's peel off, too, so no polish remover needed!
This umbrella, while compact, opens to an extra wide span. I like the button closure too. Helpful when trying to climb in your car in the rain
Really very sprouting logistics is also looking forward to a long time and finally bought the chain is just the length of praise without any defects.
I like this wallet this is something different I have never had.
Genius, i want to give a hug to whoever thought of this
very good display and easy weigh
When I first ordered this bag, I was skeptical to say the least. Over the years I have ordered products off Amazon that look good in the picture and description; however, when they arrive, they are lackluster at best. Not the case with the Polare Duffel. This duffle is extremely well built and very roomy and can easily be used as an overnight bag or longer (depending how you pack). The leather is very sturdy and the carrying strap and zippers are well designed. The pouches on the side are a nice touch; however, if I had to change anything about this bag, I would have made the pouches a bit bigger. I had also purchased the Polare backpack and the leather quality and color matches perfectly. Great quality and price. I am going to be a repeat buyer of Polare.
This wallet is so cute, so compact and holds everything I need. It snaps closed and remains flat even with all my cards in place. Perfect for my tote bag and my crossbody. Easy to use, high quality and looks amazing. The style is clean and beautiful! Best wallet I've ever owned!
My niece loves it! Good condition, cushion in the straps, overall good quality.
Fantastic and my son was pleased
This is a great umbrella... sturdy, strong, compact, & easy to use! One of the best umbrella's I have ever had, Thick material and impressed with the easy open close button! My sis was already eyeing it... so I might have to give mine away and get another one!
This backpack is useful and is a good size it's big enough to fit a 32oz hydro flask. I feel like it shouldn't be left in really hot temperatures though. But if it's just going to be used for concerts or special events or even for your job that makes you check bags before leaving it's a good backpack
My daughter really likes the backpack and has covered it with her stickers
Great size, perfect for kids, easy to write their names on with a sharpie. Thank you!
This is a very nice umbrella. It has a nice convenience of pushing a button to both open and close. I also like the wooden handle.
Customer service is fantastic I wasnt very happy with my purchase and the owner went out of his way to make it right with me. They do have beautiful products and this one instance will not prevent me from purchasing more items from them
It's perfect! I love the durability of Jansport. My little kinder girl is rough on her backpacks. I'm so glad to finally find a jansport with unicorns!
This is my second purchase from this brand. I love this purse. It is roomy without being bulky. It easily fits my daily needs (wallet, cosmetic bag, multiple badges, glasses, brush, cell phone, etc.) during the work week. I love that I can also put a file folder or notebook in it. On the weekends I'm able to also add an extra outfit for my toddler. I highly recommend this bag.
They're great, except one of the cords is missing the piece we need to secure it to our bags.
Beautiful wallet, exactly as described & pictured! Thank you!!
We went to Oahu for vacation the luggage was great
I use it for work to make it easy to scan my I.D. and it keeps business cards and certifications safe. Tuff wallet.
They are great for keeping clothing items separate and allows more packing space. Better quality than expected.
Great for labeling backpacks
Bookbag as described. Good quality and sturdy. Was stiff originally, but after using it a bit it's loosened. The bag is completly see through with plenty of pockets.
This is such a nice colored bag. It's got grey and light blue tones to it. The hook is big enough to fit over a standard towel rod. Very nicely built.
Sooo pretty! Rollers seem really good, and the lining is really great.
Perfect for goodie bags
I love my bag! It's so roomy and has aloe of pockets to hide stuff! Thanks!
Not to bad! it's very spacious and has a lot of pocket. However I don't like how it opens all the way around and I wouldn't over pack it to much because it's not so durable. The price is right though lol
This bag is great, everything I wanted! SO many pockets! Lots of little pockets for little things, and 2 nice big pockets for laptop and papers/books. Can be either a backpack or messenger bag. Nice color and fabric, too.
Good looking product. I would like that they included a smaller cube. Just my opinion. Completely happy
This is a super cute bag! I use it all the time. The only negative was that it had a weird smell when I first got it so I had to air it out. Other than that love it!
Perfect carryon bag for a kid... easy to wheel or carry and fits nicely under the seat or in overhead bin.
Great back pack got it for my niece for school she loves it
I loved both the game and the show!! Then I saw this bag and had to have it. I use it mostly for school to hold my laptop or my sketch book.
I love the price and the quality of this bag perfect for me to carrying my lunch to work.
Used for travels through Italy. Very comfortable and easy to use.
My daughter loved it!
Very sharp looking, nice fabric, great size
My wife and I bought these for a weekend bag and they turned out to be amazing. They fit a lot of stuff and makes it easy to travel with.
I got this “mommy bag” so that I can put all my baby stuff into together. It can fit all the diaper, baby wipes, formula and clothes. It's really useful while have too many baby stuff. Save my life.
This is such a good quality backpack and it costs a quarter of what the other branded backpacks do. I use it for hiking trips and it's doing its job very well so far. Very lightweight and spacious inside, plus it is water resistant so it meets all my expectations for a great hiking backpack. 5 stars for sure!
This was a replacement for a different backpack that only lasted a few weeks. Great quality, shows zero signs of wear so far.
I liked the durability, the colorful print, and the price.
Great for travel!!! I used it to my recent trip to Rome and work great!!!
Lots of compliments and questions on where I purchased it from and other available colors..Love my color selection..Great Quality ❤️
Bought this luggage set for my granddaughters 13th birthday. Quality was excellent and she loved them!
Four wheels is easy to move, there is storage on both sides and cloth liner with a zipper so that small items can be placed securely out of view under this lining. I'm traveling soon and will update after a period of time but so far, I'm very pleased. TSA locks. That's good because, for some reason, every time I've traveled lately, my luggage has been inspected. Now, if they only provided someone to pack for me?
Exactly what I needed for my study abroad trip
This is a great backpack to charge your phone or battery packs while you are outside in the beautiful sunshine! I took it on a short hike and charged my Note 9 easily while I was just walking along of course you need sunshine for this to work. I suggest using it to charge a portable phone charger for later in the day when the sun goes down. Size is adequate for most mild hiking situations.
They look great; I'd reccomend them and would purchase more
This is a beautiful set!
very useful product !
Super fast shipping!!! Much larger than expected! Perfect for my upcoming trip!
Let me tell you, this bag is the best. I travel everywhere with my 12” MacBook and 10.5” iPad Pro and a whole bunch of extra crap like chargers, notepads, more papers, various misc stuff, computer mouse, wallet - you name it. Swear I could fit my dog in this bag. Hate your job? Sneak a bottle of wine in this thing, no one will notice. Your coworkers will be asking why you brought an empty bag to work. And talk about stylish. This bag cost me $50 but has people asking if I drive a Rolls Royce. One guy asked if I was the CFO for Facebook. This thing makes you look like a million bucks. It's also the most durable bag I've ever seen. I accidentally ran it along some sandpaper and turned it into card stock with no damage to the bag. In all seriousness though, very great bag. Roomy, professional, and well crafted. Silver accents with the zippers and strap adjusters are the cherry on top.
Works very well. My husband uses it for his laptop and his carryon. So far stays in tact.
This is big! I was able to load this bag up with all kinds of stuff for myself and four friends while on vacation. We had a couple rooms that were without a safe and were able to attach this to bed frames to keep our goods locked up while away. We were able to put passports, currency, phones, Apple Watch, full sized camera, a sentimental plush Clifford (gotta bring your lifelong homie of vacation), and tablets all at the same time. I did replace the lock with a different one though, but only bc TSA locks have that universal key lock and I didn't feel that was a good idea for a portable safe. It is a bit rigid though and will need to be stored and transported flat.
Wanted a unique passport cover. Love it.
I loved the color and I especially love the button to close the umbrella. Makes getting in the car so much easier in a downpour.
If you have a daughter who is in competition dance this array of eyelashes helped me immensely. It is highly recommended. I had more than enough for my daughter and even had more than enough to share with other competition mates.
Love this bag! I got this for weekend trips so my husband and I could just combine our packing. We also plan on packing this in our backpack for our upcoming trip to Europe in case we come back with more than we left with - you can just unfold the bag, pack it with clothes, and check that bag! I anticipate this helping us tremendously especially since it folds and zips up neatly when empty. I also LOVE the grey color with the red details. Looks great!
My 1st trip using them is coming up. I love the look of them. I'll update after I actually pack with them. Update: these are fantastic. I used them. My clothes came out nicely folded. So easy to unpack. I love them!
great product .. was sort of challenging to set my own code but with the help of the directions included and video to help, it made the process easier..
It was what I was looking for. Thanks
I really like this bag because it's very large and can carry a lot of things. What's really nice about this bag is that I can fold it up when I'm not using it. This bag is also waterproof so I don't have to worry about my bag being wet near water. Another great feature about this bag is that there's an opening in the back that allows my suitcase handle to go through. That way my bag can stay of the suitcase without my worrying about it falling off.
Love everything about this!!
Sturdy still Holding up good after months of use
The duffel bag is of good quality but weighs very heavy. The only negative that I found
So far... Its great bag, I can put my shoes away in the side packet but after game time, dirty close goes into the side packet and shoes in. So far im happy
Really tames the edges
I love it! It's cute I haven't seen any kid with it they usually have the teddy bear. Seems like this one has more room My son just started walking last week so I can't wait til he gets better at it to use it.
Works well, as advertised. Now I don't have to worry about bag on the top falling off. I had several people on a recent tour we took ask about it.
This wallet compares my previous tommy wallet, the horse skin material can also be so comfortable, the packaging is ok, give a person is good.
